# QUESTIONS: 
# how many datasets have annotations
# of those annotated, how many attributes are annotated vs. not
# which attributes aren't we annotating? do we see any commonalities across datasets?
# do the semantic terms match the attributes well?
# are data team interventions necessary for semantic annotaiton accuracy?
# does semantically annotating data result in more accurate and precise searches?
