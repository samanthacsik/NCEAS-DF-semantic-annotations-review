# QUESTIONS: 

Basic 
1. how many datasets have annotations - DONE
2. of those annotated, how many attributes are annotated vs. not - DONE
3. which attributes aren't we annotating? do we see any commonalities across datasets?

More challenging to answer...
4. do the semantic terms match the attributes well?
5. are data team interventions necessary for semantic annotaiton accuracy?
6. does semantically annotating data result in more accurate and precise searches?
