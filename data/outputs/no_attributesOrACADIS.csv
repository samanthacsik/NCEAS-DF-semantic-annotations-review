Large discrepancies remain between bottom-up and top-down estimates of northern CH4 emissions. To explore whether these discrepancies are due to poor representation of non-growing season CH4 emissions, we synthesized non-growing season and annual CH4 flux measurements from temperate, boreal, and tundra wetlands and uplands. Median non-growing season wetland emissions ranged from 0.9 g/m² in bogs to 5.2 g/m² in marshes and were dependent on moisture, vegetation, and permafrost. Annual wetland emissions ranged from 0.9 g/m²/y in tundra bogs to 78 g/m²/y in temperate marshes. Uplands varied from CH4 sinks to CH4 sources with a median annual flux of 0.0 ± 0.2 g/m²/y. The measured fraction of annual CH4 emissions during the non-growing season (observed: 13 to 47%) was significantly larger than was predicted by two process-based model ensembles, especially between 40-60º N (modeled: 4 to 17%). Constraining the model ensembles with the measured non-growing fraction increased total non-growing season and annual CH4 emissions. Using this constraint, the modeled non-growing season wetland CH4 flux from > 40° north was 6.1 ± 1.5 Tg/y, three times greater than the non-growing season emissions of the unconstrained model ensemble. The annual wetland CH4 flux was 37 ± 7 Tg/y from the data-constrained model ensemble, 25% larger than the unconstrained ensemble. Considering non-growing season processes is critical for accurately estimating CH4 emissions from high latitude ecosystems, and necessary for constraining the role of wetland emissions in a warming climate. This dataset contains the synthesis of measured flux data from the study.",2018-01-01T08:00:00Z,2018-10-29T18:18:49Z

Data was gathered from scientific literature descriptions of lake cores, peat cores underlain by lake sediments, and exposures within the domain of glaciation and permafrost extent during the Last Glacial Maximum. We distinguished eight classes of lake origin. Where not indicated by the author, we sought to determine lake origin from lithology, geological history and site descriptions within the text. Though most records (95%) were radiocarbon dated, we included robust dates obtained by a variety of methods including varve counting, photoluminescence, Pb/Cs, Th/U, wiggle matching and tephrochronology. We reported oldest sample ages in the majority of cases, electing not to utilize basal ages derived from age-depth models extrapolated beyond dated levels due to both their high level of uncertainty and differences between methodologies used to construct each model. We excluded dates from shallow lake cores that clearly did not reach basal lake sediments, or that were collected for the sole purpose of methods development or recent human impact studies. Records that did not include dates from lower-most cored sediments, that suffered from uncorrected reservoir effects (noted by original author) or that contained copious age reversals were also excluded. Some records provided distinct stratigraphic evidence of lake formation that allowed for exact determination of lake basal age, while other lithologies were more ambiguous. To address this uncertainty, we categorized each lake age as ""minimum"" or ""basal"" based on interpretation of contextual, geographical and lithological information.",2018-01-01T08:00:00Z,2018-09-17T23:50:45Z

This dataset contains data collected mostly around outlet glaciers in Greenland, including a large grid at Jakobshavn, with the specific purpose of improving understanding in this dynamic and fast changing part of the ice sheet. This product uses focused synthetic aperture array (SAR) processing to improve resolution in along-track. The array processing technique used to combine the multiple channels is based on the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm. The data product format is a Mathworks MATLAB file.  Files are named according to the format: Data{$image_id}_{$frame_id}.mat. The {$image_id} is a string which may be empty when it is a composite image or is of the form “img_II” where II is the 2-digit zero-padded image number always starting with 1 and incrementing from there. The frame ID is a concatenation of the segment ID and a frame number and follows the format YYYYMMDD_SS_FFF where FFF is the frame number from 000 to 999. For example, “Data_img_01_20080630_02_001.mat” contains data for image 01 from segment 02, frame 001, taken on 2008-06-30.

                                            For approximately nine months of the year, the waters of arctic lakes are under ice.  Despite the duration of the 
                                            ice-covered period, few studies have addressed the limnology (biological, chemical, and physical features) of these
                                            lakes during their ice-covered period.  However, under ice circulation affects the background hydrodynamic state of lakes
                                            during the summer.  We aim to look at the full year cycle lake circulation in order to quantify the effects of hydrodynamics
                                            on nutrient and gas fluxes and place the results within the context of climate change in the Arctic.  In this study, we propose to 
                                            carry out several goals:  (1) to quantify physical controls on under ice thermal structure and circulation, mixing of snow melt 
                                            waters and mixing during spring and fall  (2) to quantify respiration rates in arctic lakes of differing morphology and geological 
                                            substrates  (3) to illustrate the linkages and feedbacks between these physical and biogeochemical processes.  The proposed research

The Principal Investigators (PIs) propose to design and develop an integrated underwater acoustic sensor network for ice-covered seas. It will transmit data wirelessly through acoustic waves from sub-surface ocean sensors to a receiving array with a surface connection to satellites and the Internet. The PIs will expand the limits and capabilities of underwater communication networks in the transition zone where sea ice changes from 1) smooth land-fast ice to 2) ridged mobile ice to 3) open water. This transition zone evolves in both time and space within the 30-50 km foot-print of the proposed networked sensor and communication network array. This goal requires integration of both existing knowledge from a set of diverse disciplines and intellectual innovations within each discipline. It will modify underwater communication network theory, coastal acoustic propagation and scattering, and experimental design of oceanography. Providing long-term, long-range acoustic connectivity, the PI team will address three major new research challenges: 1) Mid-frequency (1-5 kHz), mid-range (10 km) acoustic wave propagation in the transition zone; 2) Data telemetry in the new communication environment; and 3) Resilient sensor networks that cope with and harness complex dynamics of the transition zone. The multi-disciplinary team will implement reliable modem hardware, integrate it with resilient network protocol, and optimize the system design for Arctic deployment to support an ocean experiment off Thule, Greenland.  The sensor and communication network will support 1) long-term, intelligent distributed Arctic observing systems, 2) assimilation of remote-sensing and in-situ under-ice measurements, and 3) regional and global climate modeling with real-time measurements. Such a network holds the promise to revolutionize under-ice ocean sampling in polar regions. Data will be broadly disseminated via the web and archived for public access. Planned outreach includes participation in the field program of Greenlandic residents from the Inupiat village of Qaanaaq and meaningful classroom involvement from the elementary to community college levels. The PIs are also committed to outreach through their global print, radio, television, and electronic media contacts.",2019-01-01T08:00:00Z,2019-04-12T18:45:09Z

The Arctic ice pack has suffered continued thinning and reduction in seasonal extent, resulting in changes to the amount of sunlight penetrating through the ice and into the ocean beneath, having consequences for the physical and biological environment. Sunlight absorbed by the ocean under the ice causes warming, which can lead to accelerated ice melt resulting in even more sunlight reaching the ocean. In addition, warmer water also affects living organisms, influencing the ability of Arctic adapted species to survive, and possibly promoting the northward advancement of sub-Arctic species. Thinner ice also increases light available for photosynthesis, affecting the timing of phytoplankton blooms. If phytoplankton growth occurs early in the season then zooplankton, the organisms that feed on them can miss the bloom with consequences for the entire food web of the Arctic. This project aims to provide observations to help determine how the under-ice environment is changing by using autonomous buoys which overcome the limitations of ship-based observations. The buoys have proven to be very robust and can survive for approximately one year, providing hourly observations which will be available in near-real time to the research community and interested public parties. The buoys will be deployed in early spring in the western Beaufort Sea, with anticipated drift west over the Chukchi Shelf.  This project will continue the WARM buoy initiative by improving the existing design to include increased vertical resolution of temperature and light measurements, the addition of salinity measurement to enable water mass identification, and a second fluorometer to identify sinking phytoplankton biomass. The data collected will provide a time series of important physical and biogeochemical properties over a complete seasonal cycle. It will enable us to address questions related to the effects of a thinner and more open ice pack on the absorption of solar radiation, ocean heating, the phenology of pelagic primary production, and carbon cycling. The buoys have proven to be very robust and can survive for approximately one year, providing hourly observations which will be available in near real time to the research community and interested public parties. The buoys will be deployed in early spring in the western Beaufort Sea, with anticipated drift west over the Chukchi Shelf. The Arctic ice pack acts as a barrier controlling the availability of UV and visible light to the water column. Continued thinning and reduction of seasonal Arctic ice has resulted in alterations in the timing and magnitude of solar radiation penetrating the upper Arctic Ocean. Amplification of solar radiation absorption into the ocean acts to warm and stratify the surface layer, which can induce further ice retreat and delay fall freeze-up. Resulting thermal stratification affects the ecosystem by limiting vertical replenishment of nutrients with a direct consequence on the magnitude of primary production. A warmer water column can also play a fundamental role in setting thresholds for the abundance and distribution of plankton communities, affecting trophic efficiency and promoting the northward advancement of sub-Arctic species. Thinner ice increases the light available for photosynthesis and net primary production, affecting the timing of primary production. Small timing mis-match between phytoplankton blooms and zooplankton reproductive cycles can have consequences for the entire lipid-driven Arctic marine ecosystem. Changes in the duration of UV exposure through longer open water periods has the potential to increase photochemical remineralization of terrestrial and marine organic matter and production of labile organic material that can be used by microbes. Determining the impact of solar radiation changes on warming, primary production, and photochemistry are all critical in assessing and predicting the effects of climate change on the marine carbon cycle. The measurement of these variables within and beneath the seasonal ice pack is challenging due to the limitations of ship based observations, but this can be resolved by using the autonomous WARM buoys deployed within the ice and designed to survive ice melt.",2019-01-01T08:00:00Z,2019-05-24T22:32:06Z

The study will use comprehensive paleoecological records of northern peatland and lake development to document their past spatial and temporal patterns of CH4 emission. This will enable better prediction of future emissions from northern ecosystems, particularly as surface permafrost thaws under scenarios of climate warming.  Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. Its global warming potential is many times that of carbon dioxide. Therefore, in order to develop scenarios of future climate change, it is important to be able to estimate how much methane will be released to the atmosphere due to permafrost degradation. This project will constrain that number.  Our results indicated that the interpolar CH4 gradient in the early Holocene was ~65ppb and decreased during the middle Holocene to values ~35ppb that held for the later part of the Holocene.  These results are consistent with enhanced early Holocene PanArctic CH4 emissions associated with the final retreat of the Laurentide ice sheet.",NA,2018-06-29T19:50:03Z

Evidence from Arctic and North Atlantic historical and literary sources and archaeological sites reveals frequent use of marine mammals by prehistoric hunters and scavengers and Norse settlers, but details about the uses of whale, seal, and walrus are unquantified, broad and approximate. These northern regions are critically important ecosystems to current North American economies and interests. They were home to the world's earliest whaling industries and support ongoing sealing and whaling traditions. However, we know almost nothing about the origins and scale of whale, seal, and walrus use in these once fertile waters. Given the complexity of marine food webs in regions like the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, reconstruction of preindustrial or 'pristine' maritime ecosystems is critical in modern restoration efforts and for the preservation and sustainable use of fish and mammal populations today. Without clear knowledge of ancient and early historic marine mammal populations, we cannot gauge what healthy marine mammal populations would look like today. The fourteen-member research team, from the disciplines of humanities, history, archaeology, biology, genetics and others, aims to investigate the deep history of whale, seal, and walrus use in the Eastern Arctic and North Atlantic. This research will span the first settlements of the Faroes, Iceland and Greenland in the Viking Age (beginning around 800 CE), through the Medieval Warm Period (circa 1000-1250), and concluding with the Little Ice Age at the end of the Middle Ages (1300-1500). In addition to assessing the social, cultural, and economic importance of marine mammal use among Norse populations, the research study uses cutting-edge genetic and chemical analyses to provide a far better understanding of marine mammal populations in the Arctic and North Atlantic before the major changes resulting from industrial-scale hunting beginning in the sixteenth century. Evidence from houses, burials, and trading sites, from current archaeological excavations and museum collections, as well as histories, sagas, maps, illuminated manuscripts and other traditional sources of knowledge, are combined with scientific approaches to ancient animal bones and the genetic stories that they can tell. This project will build interdisciplinary connections across the social and natural sciences, will bring together researchers and students from six countries and eleven academic institutions and museums, and will employ the most current technologies and scholarship in genetics, biology, digital humanities, and zooarchaeology. The research team hopes to uncover new evidence about the marine animals that populated medieval seas, and the manners in which medieval Icelanders, Greenlanders, and others encountered and exploited these mammals. The project team will produce scholarly articles, translations, new genetic and zooarchaeological data sets, will participate in academic conferences and public presentations, and will design both curricular and museum materials to communicate our results to a broader audience. Undergraduate and graduate students will be guided through transdisciplinary research collaborations in the US and abroad. Finally, the team scientists think that their results may also aid colleagues in the natural sciences in reconstruction of ancient seas, climates, animal populations, and environmental change, with direct application to major issues of future sustainability. This project seeks answers to fundamental questions about medieval marine mammal exploitation, focusing on Norse uses of whales, seals and walruses in the North Atlantic prior to 1500 CE. In a region dominated by charismatic Arctic megafauna, where modern industrial whaling was born and where current whaling and sealing attract global attention, the prehistory and early history of marine mammal use remain unclear in its scale and purpose. The researchers' transdisciplinary approach employs Local and Traditional Knowledge (LTK), digital humanities, environmental histories, and innovative technologies of genetic analysis to new and existing sea mammal archaeofaunal assemblages to produce a holistic long-term perspective on the social, cultural, and economic history of marine mammal use in medieval northern Europe. This research spans the first settlements of the Faroes, Iceland and Greenland in the Viking Age and the Medieval Climatic Optimum, through the Little Ice Age onset in the high Middle Ages and Early Modern periods. The length of the project survey period (+ 700 years) will result in samples across a broad range of time and space, which allows the science team to contextualize newly-generated aDNA marine mammal data across several documented periods of major climate change in the North Atlantic and Subarctic. The project will also provide a far better understanding of marine mammal dynamics in these regions prior to the major changes resulting from industrial-scale hunting impacts beginning in the sixteenth century. The project utilizes: 1) a new integration with the rich medieval written record for Iceland aided by digital and environmental humanities approaches; 2) a greatly expanded zooarchaeological database created since the International Polar Year (IPY) by the North Atlantic Biocultural Organization (NABO) research cooperative; 3) newly expanded capabilities in ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis, allowing species-level identification on a wide range of otherwise unidentifiable sea mammal bones; 4) new data management and visualization tools providing more effective cross disciplinary communication and wider public engagement through cooperation with the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NISDC) and NABO project management system; and 5) facilities for wide transdisciplinary dissemination of results through the Integrated History and Future of People on Earth (IHOPE) program as part of the Future Earth global change initiative. This project will build capacity for scientific collaboration and data management, dissemination, and visualization, while improving species-level identification, exceeding current capabilities of simple morphometric analysis or collagen fingerprinting of sea mammal bones from archaeological contexts and museum collections. In addition, it offers the promise to create important new bodies of evidence for a range of scholarly disciplines across a broad temporal and geographical series of case studies. Finally, the proposed project's use of extant data sets - textual, archaeological, biological - may provide an innovative new model for transdisciplinary analysis of premodern marine mammal use that can be applied across the North Atlantic and circumpolar Arctic. The researchers hope to establish a historical baseline of marine mammal use that reveals a more complete economic and ecological portrait of the Norse North Atlantic. Through collaborations with North Pacific and Western Arctic colleagues, the research team's work will complete a circumpolar perspective of prehistoric and early historic marine mammal exploitation. By answering fundamental questions of marine mammal use, this research has the potential to provide context or evidence for lost genetic diversity among key marine species, now under pressure from both natural and human drivers of environmental change. This integrative approach, including collaboration of scholars and students from twelve institutions across North America and Europe, also provides new models and innovative methodologies for transdisciplinary research in the social sciences and humanities, with direct application to major issues of future sustainability.",NA,2020-02-14T16:33:56Z

The CALM observational network, established in the 1990s, observes the long-term response of the active layer and near-surface permafrost to changes and variations in climate at more than 200 sites in both hemispheres. CALM currently has participants from 15 countries. Majority of sites measure active-layer thickness on grids ranging from 1 hecatre to 1 square kilometer, and observe soil temperatures. Most sites in the CALM network are located in Arctic and Subarctic lowlands. Southern Hemisphere component (CALM-South) is being organized and currently includes sites in Antarctic and South America. The broader impacts of this project are derived from the hypothesis that widespread, systematic changes in the thickness of the active layer could have profound effects on the flux of greenhouse gases, on the human infrastructure in cold regions, and on landscape processes. It is therefore critical that observational and analytical procedures continue over decadal periods to assess trends and detect cumulative, long-term changes.  The CALM program began in 1991. It was initially affiliated with the International Tundra Experiment and has been supported independently and continuously since 1998 through grants from the United States National Science Foundation (NSF).

                                            For approximately nine months of the year, the waters of arctic lakes are under ice.  Despite the duration of the

Lakes were extracted from the IfSAR DSM using a slope derivative and manual correction (Jones et al., 2017). The vertical uncertainty for correctly detecting lake-based drainage gradients with the IfSAR DSM was defined by comparing surface elevation differences of several overlapping DSM tile edges. This comparison showed standard deviations of elevation between overlapping IfSAR tiles ranging from 0.0 to 0.6 meters (m). Thus, we chose a minimum height difference of 0.6 m to represent a detectable elevation gradient adjacent to a lake as being most likely to contribute to a rapid drainage event. This value is also in agreement with field verified estimates of the relative vertical accuracy (~0.5 m) of the DSM dataset  around Utqiaġvik (formerly Barrow) (Manley et al., 2005) and the stated vertical RMSE (~1.0 m) of the DSM data (Intermap, 2010). Development of the potential lake drainage dataset involved several processing steps. First, lakes were classified as potential future drainage candidates if the difference between the elevation of the lake surface and the lowest elevation within a 100 m buffer of the lake shoreline exceeded our chosen threshold of 0.6 m. Next, we selected lakes with a minimum size of 10 ha to match the historic lake drainage dataset. We further filtered the dataset by selecting lakes estimated to have low hydrological connectivity based on relations between lake contributing area as determined for specific surficial geology types and presented in Jones et al. (2017). This was added to the future projection workflow to isolate the lake population that likely responds to changes in surface area driven largely by geomorphic change as opposed to differences in surface hydrology. Lakes within a basin with low to no hydrologic connectivity that had an elevation change gradient between the lake surface and surrounding landscape are considered likely locations to assess for future drainage potential. Further, the greater the elevation difference, the greater the drainage potential. This dataset provided a first-order estimate of lakes classified as being prone to future drainage. We further refined our assessment of potential drainage lakes by identifying the location of the point with the lowest elevation within the 100 m buffer of the lake shoreline and manually interpreted lakes to have a high drainage potential based on the location of the likely drainage point to known lake drainage pathways using circa 2002 orthophotography or more recent high resolution satellite imagery available for the Western Coastal Arctic Plain (WACP). Lakes classified as having a high drainage potential typically had the likely drainage location associated with one or more of the following: (1) an adjacent lake, (2) the cutbank of a river, (3) the ocean, (4) were located in an area with dense ice-wedge networks, (5) appeared to coincide with a potentially headward eroding stream, or (6) were associated with thermokarst lake shoreline processes in the moderate to high ground ice content terrain. We also added information on potential lake drainage pathways to the high potential drainage dataset by manually interpreting the landform associated with the likely drainage site to draw comparisons with the historic lake drainage dataset.",2019-01-01T08:00:00Z,2019-10-17T16:21:51Z

Subsistence hunting often provides a large fraction of foods, and may be more reliable in the long term than a cash economy based on nonrenewable resources. Subsistence hunting for certain species may also have cultural significance that far exceeds their dietary contribution. On the Chukchi Sea coast, pipelines connecting offshore oil wells to onshore terminals must be built across a nearshore corridor used by most marine birds and mammals that migrate to the western North American Arctic. These animals are hunted for subsistence by local Natives. During spring, these animals travel through a zone of open water that forms between landfast ice and moving pack ice. If an oil pipeline were ruptured by spring ice scour in this shallow zone, oil could probably not be removed from open water within broken ice during migration. Such an event could not only restrict the extent of viable habitat, but also eliminate local hunting areas. Thus, key habitats that are usually accessible to hunting should be avoided in pipeline placement. In this research, we will model habitat requirements and map viable prey densities for a formerly hunted but now threatened species (Spectacled Eider, SPEI) and a commonly hunted species (King Eider, KIEI) in the Chukchi nearshore zone, and determine long-term variability in the eiders? access to those areas through the ice. We will refine these maps with traditional ecological knowledge on conditions and areas where hunting for KIEI typically occurs. We will then estimate probabilities that different eider feeding areas that are accessible through the ice and conducive to hunting would be eliminated during migration by oil spills from pipelines built along four alternative routes. We will use this information to inform structured decision-making workshops we will hold in the Native community. These workshops will help create a local vision for sustainability, in terms of potential risks of different pipeline routes to subsistence and cultural values of eiders, relative to cash benefits of local construction projects.  Local villagers will be involved in creating and shaping the data set, and will be the main participants in structured decision-making workshops. We will integrate our work with outreach and education programs conducted in these villages by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Our project will yield important information for future evaluations and decision-making by Endangered Species and Migratory Bird Management Offices. Our modern scientific and traditional ecological data, and facilitation of community consensus-building, will expedite later impact assessments by BOEM and other agencies as oilfield development proceeds. On a hemispheric scale, the approach we develop will serve as a prototype applicable to the many such situations developing across the Arctic.",2019-11-03T07:00:00Z,2019-11-20T19:38:57Z

These animals are vital to subsistence economies and cultures, so including the needs of both animals and hunters in conservation planning is key to sustaining social-ecological systems.  In the northeast Chukchi Sea, a nearshore corridor of open water is a major spring migration route for a half million eider ducks that are hunted along the landfast ice.  Zoning areas for industrial activities or conservation should consider both eider habitat and hunter access to those habitats from the variable ice edge.  Based on benthic sampling in 2010‒2012, a model of eider foraging energetics, and satellite data on ice patterns in April and May 1997‒2011, we mapped the range of positions of the landfast ice edge relative to a given dispersion of habitat suitable for eider feeding.  In some sectors, feeding areas were too limited, or too far from landfast ice, to provide regular hunting access.  In other sectors, overlap of the ice edge with eider feeding habitat was quite variable but often within a consistent geographic range.  Areas accessible to hunters were a small fraction of total eider habitat, so areas adequate for conserving eiders would not necessarily include areas that meet the hunters’ needs.  These results can inform spatial planning of industrial activities that yield cash income critical to subsistence hunting in less developed locations.  Our study provides an approach for mapping “subsistence conservation areas” throughout the Arctic, and an example for such efforts elsewhere.  “Healthy wildlife populations, productive habitat for those populations, and access to subsistence hunting are all measures of our people’s health.”  ‒ Edward Itta, former Mayor of the North Slope Borough, Alaska (Glenn et al. 2011)  The RAR files contain geodatabases.",2019-11-16T08:00:00Z,2019-12-18T16:38:01Z

In this nearshore corridor (10–40 m depth), the eiders’ access to benthic prey during the spring is restricted to variable areas of open water within sea ice. For the most abundant species, the king eider (Somateria spectabilis), stable isotopes in blood cells, muscle, and potential prey indicate that these eiders ate mainly bivalves when traversing this corridor. Bivalves there were much smaller than the same taxa in deeper areas of the northern Bering Sea, possibly due to higher mortality rates caused by ice scour in shallow water; future decrease in seasonal duration of fast ice may increase this effect. Computer simulations suggested that if these eiders forage for greater than 15 hours per day, they can feed profitably at bivalve densities greater than 200 meters\0022 regardless of water depth or availability of ice for resting. Sampling in 2010–2012 showed that large areas of profitable prey densities occurred only in certain locations throughout the migration corridor. Satellite data in April–May over 13 years (2001–2013) indicated that access to major feeding areas through sea ice in different segments of the corridor can vary from 0% to 100% between months and years. In a warming and increasingly variable climate, unpredictability of access may be enhanced by greater effects of shifting winds on unconsolidated ice. Our results indicate the importance of having a range of potential feeding areas throughout the migration corridor to ensure prey availability in all years. Spatial planning of nearshore industrial development in the Arctic, including commercial shipping, pipeline construction, and the risk of released oil, should consider these effects of high environmental variability on the adequacy of habitats targeted for conservation.

Nowhere have the changes been more pronounced, nor happened as quickly, as in the Arctic Ocean. Pack-ice is melting, water is warming, storms are becoming stronger and more frequent, and basic circulation patterns are being altered. Our project focuses on the fate of the Pacific water that enters the Arctic Ocean through the Bering Strait. Pacific water plays a critical role in the western Arctic ecosystem. In wintertime, the cold inflowing water provides food for phytoplankton at the base of the food chain. In summertime, the warm water melts pack ice and provides freshwater to the Arctic Ocean. After the water crosses the Chukchi Sea, north of Bering Strait, some of it forms a narrow current that flows eastward along the edge of the Beaufort Sea. As part of our project we will continue to maintain a mooring positioned in the center of the current to measure its physical and biological properties. The mooring has been deployed (with a few gaps) since 2002, and during this time it has measured striking changes that need to be placed in the context of the evolving Arctic system. In addition, we will carry out shipboard surveys of the current and adjacent waters when we service the mooring, to provide a larger-scale view of the fate of the Pacific water. Past data have been widely used by the oceanographic community - in both observational and modeling studies -and are included in the annual Arctic Report Card. One graduate student will be supported on the project.  The monitoring mooring is situated at 152 degrees West near the Beaufort Sea shelfbreak, roughly 150 kilometers downstream of Pt. Barrow, Alaska. It will be deployed from fall 2018 to fall 2022 (in two 2-year installments). This will extend the timeseries at this location to 17 years. The mooring records the velocity of the water column and pack ice using two acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), and measures temperature, salinity, and pressure using a series of sensors spaced along the wire. Chlorophyll fluorescence and nitrate will be measured at 35 meters (at the top float of the mooring), and a passive acoustic recorder situated near the base of the mooring will record marine mammal calls. Zooplankton concentration will be estimated using the ADCP backscatter data. Among other things, this will allow us to determine how much water, heat, nutrients, chlorophyll, and freshwater are transported by the current, and, importantly, assess how much exchange occurs between the interior of the Arctic Ocean and the boundary waters. Upwelling occurs during all seasons along the Beaufort slope, and it appears to be increasing as the climate warms. The mooring is ideally suited to quantify the upwelling, as well as any downwelling that occurs. The shipboard sampling will include occupations of some of the Distributed Biological Observatory transects, which will contribute to that long-term study.",2019-01-01T08:00:00Z,2019-07-03T21:38:13Z

The watersheds included Chamberlin Creek (8.1 km2) and Carnivore Creek (128.9 km2). WaSiM was forced with downscaled climate simulations obtained from Cai et al (2017) representing the RCP8.5 scenario for years 2006-2035. The forcing dataset was not bias adjusted towards local mountain measurements and exhibited a warm bias at higher elevations as the simulated average July air temperature varied <1°C across the watershed, while three summers of observed air temperature showed a 3°C cooler average July air temperature at the higher (1750 masl) compared to the lower (850 masl) elevation. The simulated runoff, glacier runoff, and long-term glacier coverage is therefore biased towards an overestimated retreat of the mountain glaciers across the entire simulation period.

While the basic tenets that underlie interpretation of isotopic information appear robust in a mean sense, meteorological and glaciological processes can confound simple interpretations. Processes of concern are variations in moisture sources, cloud processes, surface ablation, blowing snow and vapor diffusion in the firn. The project objectives are to resolve fundamental uncertainties in the controls on the isotopic composition of the ice sheet through a 3-year measurement campaign at Summit, Eureka and Reykjavik. The project will use measurements and modeling to evaluate 1) the degree to which oxygen isotopic composition and deuterium excess of snow capture variations in moisture sources versus cloud microphysical conditions, and 2) the degree to which blowing snow and vapor diffusion within the firn confound accurate interpretation of variability in the isotopic record. Continuous measurements of the isotopic composition of water vapor and daily measurements of the isotopic composition of freshly-fallen and blowing snow will be made at Summit, Eureka and Reykjavik. These will be combined with measurements of the amount, size distribution, and approximate habit of falling and blowing snow, turbulence measurements to evaluate snow lofting, surface latent heat flux (ablation and frost) and energy balance, and remote sensing of polar clouds and atmospheric structure. High-resolution firn cores will be drilled to reconcile the detailed isotopic measurements and modeling with glaciological records. The new isotope measurements will jump start an emerging international pan-Arctic cooperative network of isotope measurements, which complements Arctic observations under existing Arctic Observing Network activities. The advanced measurements at Summit enhance the site as a comprehensive observatory for monitoring and understanding Arctic change.",2019-01-01T08:00:00Z,2019-07-28T22:03:39Z

However, climate-induced shrub expansion may counteract these losses if their higher-quality litter (lower C:N) is efficiently incorporated into microbial products and stabilized within the soil. Alternatively, increased C inputs could stimulate microbial decomposition of old soil organic matter (SOM) through priming mechanisms. We investigated whether inputs of low molecular weight carbon (LMW-C) induced SOM priming or retention in soils underlying Eriophorum vaginatum, an ubiquitous tussock-forming sedge, and Betula nana, a dominant shrub that is expanding its range and coverage across the Arctic. We did not find evidence of priming, defined as an increase in the decomposition of native SOM stocks, from soils underlying either vegetation type. However, microbial respiration of new LMW-C inputs was twice as high in soils underlying E. vaginatum than B. nana, while belowground retention of new LMW-C inputs was 150% higher in soils underlying B. nana. Our results highlight the extraordinary capacity of shrub-colonized soils to retain new C inputs belowground, which may mitigate soil C loss as the Arctic climate warms.

This excel workbook contains sheets with data obtained from an isotope tracing experiment performed in the Arctic tundra. Isotopically enriched glucose was syringe injected to soils underlying Betula nana (dwarf shrub) or Eriophorum vaginatum (tussock-forming sedge) in July 2014, September 2014, or May 2015.

Freshwater is discharged from the GrIS into the ocean in three forms: 1) solid ice, through the calving of icebergs; 2) surface melt and runoff, as liquid water through above-sea-level melt and supraglacial streams or subglacial discharge of glaciated areas, and rivers draining watersheds of non-glaciated areas; and 3) submarine melt on the fronts and undersides of marine-terminating glaciers and ice shelves. Beyond sea level rise, the increasing GrIS freshwater flux is raising concerns due to its impacts on global ocean circulation given its proximity to dense water formation sites in the North Atlantic, on marine ecosystems in local and regional waters surrounding Greenland, and on local communities and industries that must navigate rapidly changing ice-related hazards.  Notwithstanding its importance, estimates of the timing, magnitude, and distribution of freshwater discharge around Greenland are imperfect due to scarce observations and a limited understanding of how the freshwater is transformed by ice/ocean processes at the ice margins. To tackle this problem, we organized an international workshop to understand the current state of knowledge and identify the critical gaps and next steps in quantifying the future GrIS freshwater flux. The workshop was held prior to the 2018 American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting, included ~40 participants from nine countries, and focused on four goals:  1)	connect the communities needed to quantify freshwater input from the GrIS to the ocean;  2)	identify the needs of ocean/climate models for oceanic boundary conditions at GrIS margins;  3)	define community needs and science gaps; and  4)	prioritize how to improve estimates of the freshwater input from the GrIS to the ocean.",2019-01-01T08:00:00Z,2019-08-19T22:16:52Z

Science and society in the United States will be stronger in the long-term if the scientific workforce more closely reflects the racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity of its residents. The Arctic research community currently does not. Of the Principal Investigators funded by NSF's Arctic programs in the past five years, only 1% were African American, Hispanic, Native American, or Alaska Native. This project is catalyzing change in these demographics by engaging faculty from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) and a diverse group of undergraduate students in cutting-edge Arctic research and providing them encouragement, mentoring, and opportunities to continue pursuing Arctic studies in subsequent years.  The central element of the project is a month-long research expedition to the Yukon River Delta in Alaska. The expedition provides a deep intellectual and cultural immersion in the context of an authentic research experience that is paramount for ""hooking"" students and keeping them moving along the pipeline to careers as Arctic scientists. The overarching scientific issue that drives the research is the vulnerability and fate of ancient carbon stored in Arctic permafrost (permanently frozen ground). Widespread permafrost thaw is expected to occur this century, but large uncertainties remain in estimating the timing, magnitude, and form of carbon that will be released when thawed. Project participants are working in collaborative research groups to make fundamental scientific discoveries related to the vulnerability of permafrost carbon in the Yukon River Delta and the potential implications of permafrost thaw in this region for the global climate system.",NA,2018-04-03T18:10:33Z

The overwhelming consensus within the scientific community is that the details of snow and sea ice interactions must be better incorporated in Earth System models, yet basic information on snow processes remains poorly quantified. The limited treatment of snow in Earth System models is largely based on datasets from field experiments on multi-year ice and does not capture changing snow properties and processes. Increasingly pervasive younger, thinner ice carries a different snowpack and is likely much more sensitive to snow conditions than the multi-year ice of the past. Predicting Arctic climate requires that we understand snow on sea ice and its interactions and feedbacks among the rest of the climate system components. A particularly important aspect of snow on sea ice is its fine-scale spatial redistribution. Wind-driven snow redistribution into dunes and drifts controls thermal fluxes and melt pond formation, exerting considerable control over ice mass balance.  This dataset consists of surface elevation maps
collected with terrestrial lidar scanning. Observations seek to capture the accumulation of 
the sea ice snowpack as it evolves through the winter season. The data is a time series of roughly
monthly observations all collected over the within the same ~500x700m area on Elson Lagoon.
The data is also fixed in an ice-based reference frame, so differences in surface position are

STN was a longitudinal study analyzing four circumpolar regions, two in Russia (Chukotka and Kamchatka) and two in Alaska (Nana and Aleutian-Pribilof Islands), looking at demographic, epidemiologic, and domestic social transitions (Mason, 2004). Demographic transitions were the study of change in mortality and birth rate. Epidemiologic transitions were studied by watching the change of infectious disease and increase of lifestyle diseases. The third transition was domestic, and is summarized as the redefinition of family, family member roles, and the family’s role within the community. The overall goal was to predict future changes, especially of high-risk conditions, and encourage institutional change that would improve services for these conditions.  During the final year of the study, while in the Russian region of Chukotka, the principal investigators, two additional research staff, and 10 villagers, died in a tragic boating accident in September of 1995.  It was decided that the documents would be given to the Institute for Circumpolar Health Studies (ICHS) at the University of Alaska Anchorage where they are now housed.  If researchers are interested in accessing any STN material, a data use agreement will be set in place with the following requirements: to submit an application the UAA IRB, to honor the content of the original consent forms, and in their UAA IRB application specify how they intend to be responsive to the NSF Principles for the Conduct of Research in the Arctic. Further, ICHS will require a copy of UAA IRB's approval prior to release of STN materials.

This dataset contains data collected mostly around outlet glaciers in Greenland, including a large grid at Jakobshavn, with the specific purpose of improving understanding in this dynamic and fast changing part of the ice sheet. This product uses unfocused synthetic aperture array (SAR) processing to improve resolution in along-track. The array processing technique used to combine the multiple channels is based on the periodogram method also known as delay and sum beamforming. The data product format is a Mathworks MATLAB file.  Files are named according to the format: Data{$image_id}_{$frame_id}.mat. The {$image_id} is a string which may be empty when it is a composite image or is of the form “img_II” where II is the 2-digit zero-padded image number always starting with 1 and incrementing from there. The frame ID is a concatenation of the segment ID and a frame number and follows the format YYYYMMDD_SS_FFF where FFF is the frame number from 000 to 999. For example, “Data_20080627_05_001.mat” contains data for a composite image from segment 05, frame 001, taken on 2008-06-27.

It does so by measuring the spatial and temporal patterns of sediment erosion, properties of basal till, basal water pressure, basal motion, ice deformation, surface velocities, surface mass balance, and changes in surface elevation and terminus position. This will be accomplished through a comprehensive observational program using radio echo sounding, reflection seismics, borehole observations, GPS, satellite remote sensing, and airborne LiDAR and digital photogrammetry. All observations will be interpreted with the help of numerical models that explore the effects of changing boundary conditions and the longer term evolution, taking into account the effects of sediment excavation. The work will be carried out at Taku Glacier, Southeast Alaska where all relevant processes are currently active. This project will impact model studies on glacier and ice sheet evolution, as well as interpretations of sedimentary records from past glaciations.

doi:10.18739/A2125Q85R,Lloyd Keigwin,"Data from Cruise Healy 1302 along the Beaufort Margin, Arctic Ocean, 2013",NA,"We conducted a survey along the Beaufort margin to investigate the origin of the Younger Dryas cooling that began about 13,000 years ago. For decades this cold event has been associated with sea ice in the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans, and the storage and release of fresh water from a large glacial lake in North America, yet its origin remains controversial. Radiocarbon dates, isotope data, acoustic character and grain size data have fingerprinted the potential catastrophic flood deposit along the Beaufort margin in the Arctic Ocean. The marine evidence is consistent with the onshore data and provides a much-improved age model for the catastrophic glacial lake draining.  The origin of Younger Dryas (YD) cooling at ~13 ka, after 2 kyr of postglacial warming, is a century-old climate problem. The YD is thought to have resulted from a slow-down of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) in response to a flood of Laurentide ice sheet meltwater from glacial Lake Agassiz in Canada. Although there is no oxygen isotopic (d18O) evidence in the western North Atlantic for a local source of meltwater where it was predicted, we report here that the eastern Beaufort Sea contains the long-sought d18O minimum at ~12.9 ka, suggesting that Lake Agassiz meltwater flowed down the Mackenzie River and into the Arctic Ocean. This fresh water would have traveled north along the Canadian Archipelago, and through Fram Strait to the Nordic Seas where surface freshening and freezing near sites of deep water formation would have suppressed convection and caused the YD by reducing the AMOC.  During the Younger Dryas dramatic changes to regional climates occurred. Models of oceanographic circulation predict that freshwater from the glacier lakes made their way from the Arctic to the north Atlantic Ocean. There it disrupted a circulation pattern that stretches from Greenland to the Southern Ocean. In normal mode, the AMOC transports warm equatorial waters poleward and releases heat to the atmosphere. Such a disruption caused substantial cooling in Europe, The Younger Dryas in fact takes its name from a flower (Dryas octopetala) that flourished in the continent’s cold conditions at the time. The Younger Dryas cooling lasted only a short time in an overall warming period that lasted 20,000 years, but it’s an important example of how feedbacks affect the climate system. Overall trends of warming or cooling on Earth are not linear but are punctuated by reversals and accelerations such as this one. Such events help scientists interpret current trends, distinguishing global climate signals from regional signals.  The findings from this study will stimulate more research on how much fresh water is really necessary to cause a change in the system and weakening of the AMOC. It certainly calls further attention to the warming we're observing in the Arctic today, and the accelerated melting of Greenland ice. Earlier in 2018, a paper published by researchers at the University College London and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution found evidence that the AMOC hasn’t been running at peak strength since the mid-1800s and is currently at its weakest point in the past 1,600 years. Continued weakening could disrupt weather patterns from the U.S. and Europe to the African Sahel. In summary, it is important to study past rapid climate events because they may provide important clues regarding future events.

The CALM observational network, established in the 1990s, observes the long-term response of the active layer and near-surface permafrost to changes and variations in climate at more than 200 sites in both hemispheres. CALM currently has participants from 15 countries. Majority of sites measure active-layer thickness on grids ranging from 1 hecatre to 1 square kilometer, and observe soil temperatures. Most sites in the CALM network are located in Arctic and Subarctic lowlands. Southern Hemisphere component (CALM-South) is being organized and currently includes sites in Antarctic and South America. The broader impacts of this project are derived from the hypothesis that widespread, systematic changes in the thickness of the active layer could have profound effects on the flux of greenhouse gases, on the human infrastructure in cold regions, and on landscape processes. It is therefore critical that observational and analytical procedures continue over decadal periods to assess trends and detect cumulative, long-term changes.  The CALM program began in 1991.

The overwhelming consensus within the scientific community is that the details of snow and sea ice interactions must be better incorporated in Earth System models, yet basic information on snow processes remains poorly quantified. The limited treatment of snow in Earth System models is largely based on datasets from field experiments on multi-year ice and does not capture changing snow properties and processes. Increasingly pervasive younger, thinner ice carries a different snowpack and is likely much more sensitive to snow conditions than the multi-year ice of the past. Predicting Arctic climate requires that we understand snow on sea ice and its interactions and feedbacks among the rest of the climate system components. A particularly important aspect of snow on sea ice is its fine-scale spatial redistribution. Wind-driven snow redistribution into dunes and drifts controls thermal fluxes and melt pond formation, exerting considerable control over ice mass balance.",2019-06-30T07:00:00Z,2020-01-07T19:05:39Z

Ice streams are bounded by abrupt transitions in speed called shear margins. Some shear margins are fixed by subglacial topography, but others are thought to be self‐organizing, evolving by thermal feedback to ice viscosity and basal drag which govern the stress balance of ice sheets. Resistive stresses (and properties governing shear‐margin formation) manifest nonuniquely at the surface, motivating the use of subsurface observations to constrain ice sheet models. In this study, we use ice‐penetrating radar data to evaluate three three-dimensional thermomechanical models of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream, focusing on model reproductions of ice temperature (a primary control on viscosity) and subsurface velocity. Data/model agreement indicates elevated temperatures in the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream margins, with depth‐averaged temperatures between 2 degrees celsius and 6 degrees celsius warmer in the southeast margin compared to ice in streaming flow, driven by vertical heat transport rather than shear heating.

This Sentinel-1 based product provides a first estimate of firn aquifer presence covering the full Greenland ice sheet at 1 kilometer (km) resolution. The detection of aquifers relies on a delay in the freezing of meltwater within the ﬁrn above the water table, causing a distinctive pattern in the radar backscatter. The total aquifer area is estimated at 54,800 square kilometers (km 2 ). This data set can help improve our understanding of the role of firn aquifers in the complex ice sheet system. With continuity of Sentinel-1 ensured until 2030, our study lays a foundation for monitoring the future response of ﬁrn aquifers to climate change.

doi:10.18739/A2WP9T61N,Mukul Sharma,Osmium concentration and isotope composition at ultra-low levels in polar ice and snow,Trace elements Ice sheets Meteorite,"The abundances of Platinum Group Elements (PGEs: Ruthenium, Rhodium, Palladium, Osmium, Iridium, and Platinum) are high in meteorites and extremely low in terrestrial rocks and water and accumulations of mainly platinum and iridium in ancient polar archives have been argued to trace terrestrial (continental/volcanic dust) and extra-terrestrial sources. The PGE concentration data, however, lack specificity. For example, the extent to which terrestrial dust compared to cosmic dust has contributed to the PGE inventory of polar ice cannot be readily evaluated from the PGE concentration data alone. Since the osmium isotopic compositions (R(187Os/188Os) ratio) of terrestrial (= 1.40 ± 0.30) and extraterrestrial/volcanic sources (= 0.13) are distinctly different from each other, osmium isotopic composition has the potential to elucidate relative contributions from these sources in ancient polar ice. However, the determination of osmium isotopes in polar ice core archives is challenging due to extremely low concentrations (∼10E-15 g g−1), and due to the availability of small sample sizes (tens of grams). The main objective of this study is to develop a highly sensitive procedure that allows accurate and precise determination of osmium concentration and isotope composition using ~50 g of melted Greenland ice or snow.  By substantially improving previously established clean lab chemistry and high sensitivity mass spectrometry we analyzed snow collected from Summit, Greenland during 2009, 2014, and 2017. We find that the average osmium concentration of the snow is 0.459 ± 0.018 (95% C.I.) fg g−1 corresponding to an osmium flux of 0.0579 ± 0.0023 (95% C.I.) fmol cm−2 yr−1. The average R(187Os/188Os) ratio of the Summit snow is 0.264 ± 0.026 (95% C.I.). Assuming that the volcanic source is negligible, the average ratio indicates that about 0.0518 ± 0.0040 (95% C.I.) fmol cm−2 yr−1 of osmium is of cosmic derivation, corresponding to an accretion rate of extra-terrestrial osmium to the Earth of 264 ± 21 mol yr−1. This assessment is similar to the present-day accretion rate of extra-terrestrial osmium to the Earth determined by previous studies. Because of its sensitivity our procedure can be extended to study changes in the accretion of extra-terrestrial osmium over the last several hundred thousand years using samples of ice core.  The data contains osmium concentration and isotope composition of (1) reagents and procedural blanks of two Osmium purification methods (Table 1), (2) Antarctic sea snow, sea water, and NEEM firn for method comparison (Table 2), and finally (3) modern snow from Summit, Greenland for sample application (Table 3).",2018-01-01T08:00:00Z,2018-06-18T21:19:25Z

The Census Long Form Survey historically provided much of the data for measuring social and economic conditions in the United States. Its replacement with the American Community Survey (ACS) after the 2000 Census has raised serious concerns about whether Census data continue to provide accurate measures of well-being in rural Alaska communities, at a time when the region faces unprecedented environmental and socio-economic change. The project addresses the uncertainty with ACS data by developing a new set of social, economic, and cultural indicators with increased capability to detect differences at local scales.  Specific objectives include: (1) systematically examine the reliability of ACS data for rural Alaska by disaggregating published margins of error into components expressing dispersion across communities, years, and individuals; (2) construct socio-economic indicators for rural Alaska communities and regions with substantially smaller margins of error than published results; (3) estimate key indicators for communities where observations are sparse or missing entirely; and (4) test whether communities and regions have changed or differ significantly with respect to one or more indicators. The project pursues these objectives through modeling and statistical analyses of multiple primary data sources, including individual interview data from the ACS and the previous censuses in cooperation with the United States Census Bureau. Project outputs include a set of socio-economic indicators with improved reliability over published ACS figures that can help state and local governments and non-governmental organizations allocate funds, plan, and evaluate social service and economic development programs.

This dataset contains data collected mostly around outlet glaciers in Greenland, including a large grid at Jakobshavn, with the specific purpose of improving understanding in this dynamic and fast changing part of the ice sheet. This product uses focused synthetic aperture array (SAR) processing to improve resolution in along-track. The array processing technique used to combine the multiple channels is based on the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) algorithm. The data product format is a Mathworks MATLAB file.  Files are named according to the format: Data{$image_id}_{$frame_id}.mat. The {$image_id} is a string which may be empty when it is a composite image or is of the form “img_II” where II is the 2-digit zero-padded image number always starting with 1 and incrementing from there. The frame ID is a concatenation of the segment ID and a frame number and follows the format YYYYMMDD_SS_FFF where FFF is the frame number from 000 to 999. For example, “Data_img_01_20080630_02_001.mat” contains data for image 01 from segment 02, frame 001, taken on 2008-06-30.

The U.S. National Ice Center (NIC) is an inter-agency sea ice analysis and forecasting center comprised of Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Defense/U.S. Navy, and Department of Homeland Security/U.S. Coast Guard components. Since 1972, NIC has produced Arctic and Antarctic sea ice charts. This data set is an Arctic sea ice concentration climatology derived from the NIC weekly or biweekly operational ice chart time series. The charts used in the climatology are from 1972 through 2004, and the monthly climatology products are median, maximum, minimum, first quartile, and third quartile concentrations, as well as frequency of occurrence of ice at any concentration for 33 year, 10 year, and 5 year periods. These climatologies and the charts from which they are derived are provided in 25 km EASE-Grid (Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid /gridded binary). Ice extent can be derived from concentration by summing the number of equal area EASE-Grid cells. GIF browse files are also provided. The climatologies are also made available in a Geographical Information System (GIS) compatible format. NIC charts are produced through the analyses of available in situ, remote sensing, and model data sources. They are generated primarily for mission planning and safety of navigation. NIC charts generally show more ice than do passive microwave derived sea ice concentrations, particularly in the summer when passive microwave algorithms tend to underestimate ice concentration. The record of sea ice concentration from the NIC series is believed to be more accurate than that from passive microwave sensors, especially from the mid-1990s on (see references in the documentation), but it lacks the consistency of some passive microwave time series.",2009-11-18T08:00:00Z,2016-09-22T16:31:44Z

Petermann Glacier drains a significant fraction of the northern Greenland ice sheet and terminates in a large floating ice shelf that is sensitive to ice-ocean interactions. Ice retreat over the last decade opens access to the fjord and presents an opportunity to understand sedimentation processes under the area previously covered by ice shelf and to calibrate reconstructions of past ice shelf variations. Using a variety of technologies and approaches on land, ice, and at sea, the investigators will map the bottom of the fjord in front of and under the ice shelf; reconstruct ocean conditions and their role in ice shelf variations through time; reconstruct the past extent of the glacier on land and the floating ice shelf; and reconstruct local relative sea level. Together these efforts will create a comprehensive picture of the climate conditions and response of the Petermann Glacier to these conditions over the last 10,000 years.  Of key interest will be the timing, extent, rates of change, and variability (on land and in the sea) during the early Holocene when local relative sea level was over 100 meters higher than today (due to lagging isostatic rebound of the crust in response to deglaciation), but the inland ice sheet was still large relative to today. The investigators will address dynamic responses to multiple interacting variables over a range of response times (from tens to thousands of years) relevant to potential future impacts. Specific research questions include: 1) How sensitive is Petermann ice shelf extent to documented climate changes within the Holocene? 2) Is shelf response independent of, or linked to, variations in the grounded Petermann Glacier, ocean thermal conditions, or relative sea level (i.e., sill depth)? 3) What are the rates of change and variability of these systems in response to early Holocene warming, Neoglacial cooling, and recent warming? The project will support several young investigators and will provide them with both ship and land-based training experiences. The project includes significant international collaborations, with substantial in-kind contributions from non-U.S. sources that add value to the project.

The extent to which the Greenland Ice Sheet will lose mass and contribute to rising sea level in the coming decades depends on the discharge from glaciers at its edges and on the surface mass balance, which is the balance between snow accumulation and surface melt. Estimates of Greenland surface mass balance increasingly utilize climate reanalyses and high-resolution regional climate models to determine snow accumulation, surface melt and runoff/refreeze. These models show significant, and model-dependent, biases (differences from observations) along the steep edges of the Greenland Ice Sheet where the highest and most variable (in space and time) rates of accumulation and surface melt are observed. Thus, the edges of the Greenland Ice Sheet are in critical need of updated accumulation and melt data to validate models and improve mass balance estimates. The investigators propose a traverse in the Western Greenland percolation zone over two field seasons to develop continuous in-situ snow accumulation and firn density records using ground-based radar and shallow firn cores. The research objectives include: (1) determining the patterns, in time and space, of snow accumulation in Western Greenland over the past 20-40 years; (2) evaluating surface melt refreeze and englacial meltwater storage in the Western Greenland percolation zone over the past 20-40 years; and (3) quantifying the accumulation and surface melt biases of the most recent climate reanalysis models and their regional climate model counterparts.  These data are radar echograms from the GreenTrACS  multi-channel 500 MHz ground-penetrating radar operated in a multi-offset configuration. The multi-channel radar technique accurately and independently estimates density, depth, and annual snow accumulation -- between the Greenland Traverse for Accumulation and Climate Studies (GreenTrACS) firn core and snow pit sites -- by horizon velocity analysis of common midpoint radar reflections from the snow and shallow firn.",2019-01-01T08:00:00Z,2019-02-04T22:00:49Z

This research effort will synthesize a number of recent, upcoming, and historical datasets to create three regional carbon budgets for the Chukchi/western Beaufort Sea, the Bering Sea, and the northern Gulf of Alaska. As waters from the North Pacific make their way through these regions a number of transformations occur that modify them before they enter the central Arctic Ocean. In general, the waters exiting these shelf seas are fresher, colder, and have lower pH due to the uptake of CO2 and the remineralization of organic matter. Because of the importance that biogeochemical transformations have in preconditioning the waters of the central Arctic and ultimately parts of the North Atlantic it is important to gain a better understanding of how these processes impact the carbon biogeochemistry of the region. The investigators propose to address this issue by better constraining the carbon budgets for three zones in the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean including coastal fluxes, rates of primary production and air-sea exchange of CO2 as well as developing algorithms with predictive capabilities for carbonate mineral saturation states. The aim of this effort is to determine how physical forcing and biological responses control the marine carbon cycle including the rates of air-sea CO2 exchange and net community production as well as ocean acidification effects in the contrasting shelf environments, and to better constrain the present stocks and fluxes of carbon and determine how climate change will affect the regional carbon cycle.

Many of these water bodies traditionally freeze solid during the winter, preserving sub-lake permafrost and keeping soil carbon stocks immobile at depth. Slightly deeper lakes maintain some liquid water beneath floating ice, causing deep thaw zones in otherwise continuous permafrost. Evidence suggests that thinner ice growth in response to warmer, snowier winters is pushing many bedfast ice lakes to floating ice regimes. If such a regime shift becomes pervasive across lake-rich landscapes, resulting permafrost thaw and enhanced moisture and heat flux could generate positive feedbacks, further amplifying this regime change.  This project examines the extent and dynamics of bedfast and floating ice lakes in relation to hypothesized interactions and feedback with permafrost and climate. A combination of remote sensing, field monitoring and geophysical measurements, experiments and physical models are used to isolate processes, quantify interactions and project changes. Project findings will be relevant locally for native village subsistence and for water supply to the petroleum industry, and globally for scientists studying permafrost thaw and Arctic climate change.",2018-01-01T08:00:00Z,2018-08-15T16:58:13Z

                                            For approximately nine months of the year, the waters of arctic lakes are under ice.  Despite the duration of the 
                                            ice-covered period, few studies have addressed the limnology (biological, chemical, and physical features) of these
                                            lakes during their ice-covered period.  However, under ice circulation affects the background hydrodynamic state of lakes
                                            during the summer.  We aim to look at the full year cycle lake circulation in order to quantify the effects of hydrodynamics
                                            on nutrient and gas fluxes and place the results within the context of climate change in the Arctic.  In this study, we propose to 
                                            carry out several goals:  (1) to quantify physical controls on under ice thermal structure and circulation, mixing of snow melt 
                                            waters and mixing during spring and fall  (2) to quantify respiration rates in arctic lakes of differing morphology and geological

Water samples were collected from six watersheds near the Arctic Long Term Ecological Research Station on the North Slope of Alaska. All rivers drain continuous permafrost, but three drain tussock tundra-dominated watersheds (Kuparuk, Imnaviat, and Oksrukuyuk) and three drain bare bedrock catchments with minor tundra influences (Atigun, Roche, and Trevor). Water samples were collected from April until October in 2009 and 2010. Water samples were characterized in the field for pH, temperature, conductivity, and alkalinity (Gran titration). In the laboratory, samples were analyzed for concentrations of cations (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Sr, and NH4), anions (Br, Cl, F, NO2, NO3, PO4, and SO4), Si, TDN, DOC, DON, POC, PON, and trace metals (Be, B, Al, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Sr, Mo, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb, Te, and Ba). River samples were analyzed for O and H isotope ratios (18O/16O and 2H/1H) to identify water sources. Sulfur isotope ratios (34S/32S) of SO4 were measured to track riverine sulfate sources. C and N isotope ratios (13C/12C and 15N/14N) of POC were measured to track sources of organic carbon in streams. Ca and Sr isotope ratios (44Ca/40Ca, 44Ca/42Ca, and 87Sr/86Sr), combined with C isotope ratios (13C/12C) of DIC, were measured to track solute sources from mineral weathering. Two soil cores were collected from Imnaviat watershed. Cores were sectioned into 5cm intervals and were analyzed by XRF (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Ba, Fe, Cu, Zn, Ga, Pb, Br, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, and Tl).

A crucial element of SHEBA is to extend process-oriented observations and models to larger-scales. Local measurements provide data on mass changes, optical properties, and structural properties of individual ice categories, and ground surveys allowed us to define spatial variability within each category. We then use larger scale aerial surveys to generate regional estimates of the fractional area covered by these categories. Combining these observations with process-oriented modeling results makes it possible to generate aerially averaged estimates of such quantities as albedo, solar heat input to the ice and ocean, ice concentration, pond fraction, and lateral melt rates.

doi:10.18739/A2TQ5RD83,Claire Simpson,"Modeled Bathymetry Maps of 17 Lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska, 2017",Bathymetry Lake Depth North Slope,"The goal of this project was to test the application of spectral depth
models to quantify lake water volumes on the Inner Arctic Coastal Plain of
Alaska. Lakes in this area tend to be deeper than those nearby and store a
significant amount of the region’s water, making them important in terms of
energy balance, as ecological habitat, and as water sources for
infrastructure (e.g. ice roads). Due in part to their depth, these lakes
have often been neglected by the limited number of prior studies that also
focus on lakes in northern Alaska. Techniques employed by these studies limit the magnitude, precision,
and/or scale at which depths can be assessed. By analyzing remotely sensed
lake color using a method typically reserved for coastal bathymetry
mapping, we are able to predict deeper depths and thus more accurately
evaluate deep Arctic lake water volumes.  This dataset includes 30 meter resolution bathymetry rasters for 17 lakes
on the Alaskan Arctic Coastal Plain. These depth maps were created using
linear and exponential models tuned with sonar depth measurements (depth dataset: doi:10.18739/A2SN01440) and applied to a Landsat-8 image (image ID: LC08_L1TP_076011_20160805_20170222_01_TI). The 12 model variants we
tested were each distinguished by the two Red-Green-Blue (RGB) bands used,
linear or exponential growth pattern, and simple or transform ratio. We
were able to successfully tune models at the scale of an individual lake,
predicting depth with an average model uncertainty (based on root mean squared error) of 1.44 meters. Volumes derived from the provided bathymetry rasters may be useful for understanding the distribution of water across
northern Alaska and providing context for future changes in the landscape.  Models were derived in part from: Stumpf, R. P., Holderied, K., and

The CALM observational network, established in the 1990s, observes the long-term response of the active layer and near-surface permafrost to changes and variations in climate at more than 200 sites in both hemispheres. CALM currently has participants from 15 countries. Majority of sites measure active-layer thickness on grids ranging from 1 hecatre to 1 square kilometer, and observe soil temperatures. Most sites in the CALM network are located in Arctic and Subarctic lowlands. Southern Hemisphere component (CALM-South) is being organized and currently includes sites in Antarctic and South America. The broader impacts of this project are derived from the hypothesis that widespread, systematic changes in the thickness of the active layer could have profound effects on the flux of greenhouse gases, on the human infrastructure in cold regions, and on landscape processes. It is therefore critical that observational and analytical procedures continue over decadal periods to assess trends and detect cumulative, long-term changes.  The CALM program began in 1991.

The aerial photographs were collected from small fixed wing aircraft during the summer months of July or August.  Each photograph consists of a red, green, and blue spectral band.  Photographs of each research area were collected with a high degree of front and side overlap.  The overlapping photographs of each research area, by year, were merged using Adobe Photoshop, photogrammetry and/or GIS software.  When available, GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) data were used during processing to create spatially referenced and terrain-corrected orthophotographic mosaics (ie, orthophotos). ToolikGIS uses orthophotos to help scientists select new research sites and support terrestrial change detection analyses. This orthophoto collection was created to serve primarily as a basemap in a GIS to support scientific research activities operating out of Toolik Field Station.  When viewed in concert with corresponding orthographic photographs from 2002, 2007, and 2018, preliminary change detection analyses may be possible.

doi:10.18739/A2Z60C21V,Andy Aschwanden,"Collaborative Research: Understanding the controls on spatial and temporal variability in ice discharge using a Greenland-wide ice sheet model, 2008-3007",ice sheets cryosphere models PISM ice sheet model,"Sea level is observed to be rising at an increasing rate. A significant contribution during the past decades has been from mountain glaciers, but the contribution from the Greenland Ice Sheet is anticipated to become dominant in the near future. This contribution is delivered to the ocean as both meltwater and icebergs that melt in the fjords and coastal ocean around Greenland. These contributions vary spatially. The proposed work will develop a model of Greenland's contribution to sea level rise, constrain the model using observed data, and estimate contributions based on scenarios of future climate.  The project will contribute to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) workforce development by providing support for the training of two graduate students. It will also provide support for a beginning investigator during the formative years of his career. It will contribute to the community resources by maintaining and enhancing the open source Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) code for community use.  Four possible controls on outlet glacier systems dynamics have been identified:  1) Warming subsurface ocean water and/or increased subglacial runoff may increase submarine ice melting at the glacier-fjord interface;  2) Rigid sea ice and ice mélange (a mixture of sea ice and icebergs) may suppress calving, allowing for terminus advance;  3) The terminus position relative to subglacial topography (e.g., over-deepenings or sills) influences rates of retreat; and  4) Changes in the resistive stress caused by contact with the fjord walls and/or glacier bed can lead to terminus advance, retreat, and/or thinning.  Previous simulations of ice sheet contributions to sea level rise have been limited by the insufficient spatial resolution of models and observational data, which prevented whole-ice sheet simulations to faithfully capture outlet glacier flow. Results to date are either obtained from regional models or from highly idealized flow line models that were upscaled to ice-sheet scale. Recent advances in ice sheet modeling, and the availability of high-resolution subglacial topography, now allow one to resolve individual outlet glacier flow in ice sheet-wide simulations. This project will use the framework of the open-source Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM), uni-directionally coupled to new high-resolution hindcasts of the atmosphere and ocean. This will provide a test bed for assessing, on a glacier-by-glacier basis:  1) what is the relative present-day influence of the four controls on outlet glacier flow and ice discharge;  2) what is the potential for a substantial increase in 21st century ice discharge;  3) what conditions would precipitate large changes (e.g., spatio-temporal distribution of ocean warming, enhanced surface runoff); and  4) what observations are required in support of a Greenland Ice Sheet Ocean Observing System to capture the forcing or onset of large changes?  Comparison to available remotely-sensed and in-situ observations, including, but not limited to, time-series of surface velocities, surface elevation, and mass changes will serve as metrics of success. Simulations of the 21st century evolution of the Greenland Ice Sheet will then be performed, forced by available atmosphere-ocean projections, to provide realistic estimates of future ice discharge.",2019-01-01T08:00:00Z,2019-06-17T19:19:15Z

We define rural Alaska as the region corresponding to Census Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) 400, known also as the Subsistence Alaska PUMA. The ACS is an annual survey. However, due to small sample sizes, the ACS publishes estimates for places and census areas/boroughs only as five-year moving averages. Even with the averaging over five years, estimates of economic conditions vary substantially over time in many communities, and high margins of error make it difficult to distinguish communities from each other. Using individual Census and ACS records accessed through the Census Research Data Center program, we estimated censored and logistic regression equations with random community effects that explained individual survey responses for year-round employment, individual and household earnings, individual and household income, and poverty status for individuals indicating AIAN identity, either alone or in combination with other races. Explanatory variables in the equations included Alaska Department of Labor place-level employment and earnings, Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend payments, and characteristics of individuals and households such as age, gender, presence and number of children in the household, etc., that can be benchmarked with precision to the 2000 and 2010 census counts. Annual predicted values of the equations averaged over individuals in each community were combined with survey means adjusted for random interannual survey age and gender variation to produce empirical Bayes synthetic annual estimates with margins of error comparable or smaller than the published five-year averages. The synthetic estimates include the regression-based predicted values for years 2001 through 2004 when no survey data were collected.  Data are restricted by the US Census Bureau to avoid disclosure of individual information until approved for public release. The data are still under disclosure review, and will be provided if released.",2019-01-01T08:00:00Z,2019-07-22T19:22:50Z

The CALM observational network, established in the 1990s, observes the long-term response of the active layer and near-surface permafrost to changes and variations in climate at more than 200 sites in both hemispheres. CALM currently has participants from 15 countries. Majority of sites measure active-layer thickness on grids ranging from 1 hecatre to 1 square kilometer, and observe soil temperatures. Most sites in the CALM network are located in Arctic and Subarctic lowlands. Southern Hemisphere component (CALM-South) is being organized and currently includes sites in Antarctic and South America. The broader impacts of this project are derived from the hypothesis that widespread, systematic changes in the thickness of the active layer could have profound effects on the flux of greenhouse gases, on the human infrastructure in cold regions, and on landscape processes. It is therefore critical that observational and analytical procedures continue over decadal periods to assess trends and detect cumulative, long-term changes.  The CALM program began in 1991.

Mooring deployments were funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF)-Arctic Observing Network award PLR (Division of Polar Programs)-1304052 (PI (Principal Investigator): Woodgate, Heimbach and Nguyen). The mooring work required 2 dedicated cruises:  - in 2017 (7th - 15th July), a ~ 9 day cruise on the US (United States) vessel Norseman2 deployed the moorings. Some CTD (conductivity, temperature, and depth) sections were run on this cruise, and those data are archived separately.  - in 2018 (10th - 19th August), a ~ 10 day cruise on the US vessel.  For 2017 to 2018, a total of three moorings were deployed:  - two moorings (A2 and A4) in the US channel of the strait,  - one mooring (A3) at a site just north of the strait.  In what follows, mooring names include a two digit suffix to represent year of deployment. Sites A2, and A3 were established in 1990. A2 and A3 have been occupied almost continuously (all years except 1996-1997) since then. Site A4 was established in 2001. Mooring location A2 is in the middle of the eastern (Alaskan side) channel. Mooring location A3 is just north of the strait, immediately east of the Russian-US EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone) line. Experience has shown that site A3 samples both eastern and western channel water. Mooring location A4 is close to the Alaskan coast and allows measurement of the Alaskan Coastal Current. For an overview of previous and on-going Bering Strait mooring work, please see http://psc.apl.washington.edu/BeringStrait.html. Moorings carry a variety of instruments, listed in the table below. All records are year-round, sampling hourly or more frequently (Time Interval. in table below). Data from instruments marked with * are not included in this archive.

doi:10.18739/A2QV3C39P,Natalie Monacci,"Collaborative Research: Pacific-Arctic Carbon Synthesis - Transformations, Fluxes, and Budgets, Alaska, 2008-2010",Alkalinity Inorganic Carbon Alaska Arctic Ocean Acidification,"This research effort synthesized a number of datasets to create three regional carbon budgets for the Chukchi/western Beaufort Sea, the Bering Sea, and the northern Gulf of Alaska. As waters from the North Pacific make their way through these regions a number of transformations occur that modify them before they enter the central Arctic Ocean. In general, the waters exiting these shelf seas are fresher, colder, and have lower pH due to the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and the remineralization of organic matter. Because of the importance that biogeochemical transformations have in preconditioning the waters of the central Arctic and ultimately parts of the North Atlantic it is important to gain a better understanding of how these processes impact the carbon biogeochemistry of the region. The investigators worked to better constrain the carbon budgets for three zones in the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean including coastal fluxes, rates of primary production and air-sea exchange of CO 2 as well as developing algorithms with predictive capabilities for carbonate mineral saturation states. The aim of this effort was to determine how physical forcing and biological responses control the marine carbon cycle including the rates of air-sea CO 2 exchange and net community production as well as ocean acidification effects in the contrasting shelf environments, and to better constrain the present stocks and fluxes of carbon and determine how climate change will affect the regional carbon cycle.",2019-01-01T08:00:00Z,2019-06-26T22:36:03Z

The CALM observational network, established in the 1990s, observes the long-term response of the active layer and near-surface permafrost to changes and variations in climate at more than 200 sites in both hemispheres. CALM currently has participants from 15 countries. Majority of sites measure active-layer thickness on grids ranging from 1 hecatre to 1 square kilometer, and observe soil temperatures. Most sites in the CALM network are located in Arctic and Subarctic lowlands. Southern Hemisphere component (CALM-South) is being organized and currently includes sites in Antarctic and South America. The broader impacts of this project are derived from the hypothesis that widespread, systematic changes in the thickness of the active layer could have profound effects on the flux of greenhouse gases, on the human infrastructure in cold regions, and on landscape processes.

The broader impacts of this project are derived from the hypothesis that widespread, systematic changes in the thickness of the active layer could have profound effects on the flux of greenhouse gases, on the human infrastructure in cold regions, and on landscape processes. It is therefore critical that observational and analytical procedures continue over decadal periods to assess trends and detect cumulative, long-term changes.  The CALM program began in 1991. It was initially affiliated with the International Tundra Experiment and has been supported independently and continuously since 1998 through grants from the United States National Science Foundation (NSF).

The CALM observational network, established in the 1990s, observes the long-term response of the active layer and near-surface permafrost to changes and variations in climate at more than 200 sites in both hemispheres. CALM currently has participants from 15 countries. Majority of sites measure active-layer thickness on grids ranging from 1 hecatre to 1 square kilometer, and observe soil temperatures. Most sites in the CALM network are located in Arctic and Subarctic lowlands. Southern Hemisphere component (CALM-South) is being organized and currently includes sites in Antarctic and South America. The broader impacts of this project are derived from the hypothesis that widespread, systematic changes in the thickness of the active layer could have profound effects on the flux of greenhouse gases, on the human infrastructure in cold regions, and on landscape processes.

The data are from a ~ 10 day cruise on the United States (US) vessel Norseman II from 10th-19th August 2018 sailing from and to Nome, Alaska to the Bering Strait and southern Chukchi Sea. The cruise was also to service oceanographic moorings in the strait and those data are archived separately. A total of 142 casts were taken and are included in this archive. No water samples were taken during this cruise. Stations were taken in US waters near mooring locations and on sections in the Bering Strait and southern Chukchi Sea. See cruise report for map, station locations, calibration, and processing details.  The data are taken using an SBE911p system, recording:  - pressure  - temperature (dual system)  - conductivity (dual system)  - oxygen (dual system)  - fluorescence  - turbidity  For an overview of previous and on-going Bering Strait mooring work, please see http://psc.apl.washington.edu/BeringStrait.html.

The CALM observational network, established in the 1990s, observes the long-term response of the active layer and near-surface permafrost to changes and variations in climate at more than 200 sites in both hemispheres. CALM currently has participants from 15 countries. Majority of sites measure active-layer thickness on grids ranging from 1 hecatre to 1 square kilometer, and observe soil temperatures. Most sites in the CALM network are located in Arctic and Subarctic lowlands. Southern Hemisphere component (CALM-South) is being organized and currently includes sites in Antarctic and South America. The broader impacts of this project are derived from the hypothesis that widespread, systematic changes in the thickness of the active layer could have profound effects on the flux of greenhouse gases, on the human infrastructure in cold regions, and on landscape processes. It is therefore critical that observational and analytical procedures continue over decadal periods to assess trends and detect cumulative, long-term changes.  The CALM program began in 1991.

The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) was established in the early 1990s to understand the effects of warming and environmental variability on tundra vegetation properties and ecosystem function. The ITEX program has been extremely valuable for detection of changes in tundra plant and ecosystem responses to experimental warming and to background climate change across sites that span the major ecosystems of the Arctic. In 2007, the Alaskan and Greenland ITEX sites were combined into an Arctic Observatory Network (AON). The current ITEX AON project will continue to document and understand Arctic terrestrial vegetation change and its ecosystem consequences by maintaining the long-term datasets of the ITEX-AON. The warming experiment of ITEX-AON allows us to assign the cause for observed changes in response to warming instead of relying on simple correlations. This project provides urgently needed data on changes in vegetation and the importance of these changes for ecosystem services from a variety of Arctic ecosystems. This project will provide training for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students in the emerging fields of remote sensing, cybertechnology and big-data analysis. The project will include outreach activities through strong relationships with the CLEO Institute in Miami; the Grand Valley State University Regional Math and Science Center; and K-12 school systems in Miami, Anchorage, Grand Rapids and El Paso. All data from this project are and will be freely available at the NSF Arctic Data Center.

The core datasets of the proposed research include manual observations of phenology, vegetation structure and composition, and ecosystem function (carbon flux and nutrient cycling) on long-term ITEX control and experimental warming plots, repeat measurement of vegetation plots on the long-term 1 km2 vegetation grids, and a multifactor warming/moisture experiment in Greenland. In 2009, the sampling scheme was expanded to include a larger spatial component to amplify the value of the measurements collected. This expansion included the addition of phenocams, automated mobile sensor platforms, and medium-scale aerial imagery. The automated platforms measure a suite of vegetation surface properties with minimal effort across focal transects spanning strong moisture and microtopographic gradients at a near-daily frequency. These measurements capture the fine-scale changes in vegetation over the growing season that are missed by lower frequency manual measurements and provide a bridge between manual measurements and aerial imagery. Medium-scale aerial imagery, using Kite Aerial or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, is acquired throughout the growing season for scaling of manual and automated measurements; satellite imagery is referenced to medium-scale aerial imagery to aid scaling of responses to the regional level. In the newest phase of AON ITEX, we are particularly focused on understanding the relationship between landscape subsidence as a result of permafrost thaw and vegetation structure and function because of the potential for significant positive feedbacks to climate change.",2017-05-08T07:00:00Z,2017-05-30T21:45:42Z

The CALM observational network, established in the 1990s, observes the long-term response of the active layer and near-surface permafrost to changes and variations in climate at more than 200 sites in both hemispheres.

These measurements will be used to improve estimates of rates and patterns of and controls on annual greenhouse gas fluxes, with special contribution to understanding of the fall, winter and spring fluxes. The project focuses on the rates of CH 4 emissions during the fall, winter, and spring seasons, specifically during the ""zero-curtain"" when soil temperatures remain near 0 degrees Celsius. Around this time the soil column freezes from the top-down and bottom-up and our measurements are made to be able to measure the exact extent and duration of the zero-curtain in the soil. Further this dataset allows for a better characterization of the spring thaw and growing season soil temperatures. We hope that the data may also be able to address the size and conditions of the snowpack during the cold season as well as a full profile of winter-time soil and permafrost measurements. The data-set contains half-hourly mean soil temperatures and standard deviations of 1 Hz (hertz) readings at depths every 5-10 centimeters (cm) ranging from 85 cm above the soil surface to 100 cm below the soil surface. There are two profiles at each site, at the Atqasuk site, two polygon land-forms are represented, however the land-forms at Ivotuk and Utqiagvik were homogeneous so two profiles are redundancies. Measurements were taken using type E thermocouple and AM25T multiplexers with data recorded on either Control Datalogger 1000 (CR1000) or Control Datalogger 6 (CR6) data loggers from Campbell Scientific.",2019-07-25T07:00:00Z,2019-07-29T22:48:56Z

The CALM observational network, established in the 1990s, observes the long-term response of the active layer and near-surface permafrost to changes and variations in climate at more than 200 sites in both hemispheres. CALM currently has participants from 15 countries. Majority of sites measure active-layer thickness on grids ranging from 1 hecatre to 1 square kilometer, and observe soil temperatures. Most sites in the CALM network are located in Arctic and Subarctic lowlands. Southern Hemisphere component (CALM-South) is being organized and currently includes sites in Antarctic and South America. The broader impacts of this project are derived from the hypothesis that widespread, systematic changes in the thickness of the active layer could have profound effects on the flux of greenhouse gases, on the human infrastructure in cold regions, and on landscape processes. It is therefore critical that observational and analytical procedures continue over decadal periods to assess trends and detect cumulative, long-term changes.  The CALM program began in 1991.

The aerial photographs were collected from small fixed wing aircraft during the summer months of July or August.  Each photograph consists of a red, green, and blue spectral band.  Photographs of each research area were collected with a high degree of front and side overlap.  The overlapping photographs of each research area, by year, were merged using Adobe Photoshop, photogrammetry and/or GIS software.  When available, GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) data were used during processing to create spatially referenced and terrain-corrected orthophotographic mosaics (ie, orthophotos).  ToolikGIS uses orthophotos to help scientists select new research sites and support terrestrial change detection analyses. This orthophoto collection was created to serve primarily as a basemap in a GIS to support scientific research activities operating out of Toolik Field Station.  When viewed in concert with corresponding orthographic photographs from 2007, 2013, and 2018, preliminary change detection analyses may be possible.

The CALM observational network, established in the 1990s, observes the long-term response of the active layer and near-surface permafrost to changes and variations in climate at more than 200 sites in both hemispheres. CALM currently has participants from 15 countries. Majority of sites measure active-layer thickness on grids ranging from 1 hecatre to 1 square kilometer, and observe soil temperatures. Most sites in the CALM network are located in Arctic and Subarctic lowlands. Southern Hemisphere component (CALM-South) is being organized and currently includes sites in Antarctic and South America. The broader impacts of this project are derived from the hypothesis that widespread, systematic changes in the thickness of the active layer could have profound effects on the flux of greenhouse gases, on the human infrastructure in cold regions, and on landscape processes. It is therefore critical that observational and analytical procedures continue over decadal periods to assess trends and detect cumulative, long-term changes.  The CALM program began in 1991. It was initially affiliated with the International Tundra Experiment and has been supported independently and continuously since 1998 through grants from the United States National Science Foundation (NSF). CALM is funded by the NSF Award 1304555 (Polar Programs).

Understanding this rare halogen chemistry and composition is necessary as rapid environmental changes in the Arctic have an impact globally. Typically to characterize the large-scale impact of atmospheric processes, 1-D and 3-D models are tested with known chemistry and meteorology.  To enable the pursuit of such models, a 12-m tower was erected at the Barrow Environmental Observatory during March to May 2016. During the Photochemical Halogen and Ozone eXchange: a Meterological Experiment on Layered Turbulence (PHOXMELT), the project team measured halogen fluxes and vertical mixing to constrain a 1-D (vertical scale) numerical model to investigate the impact of the surface fluxes, and how this might change as the surface is altered by climate change. Turbulence data are used to study the attributes of the Arctic atmospheric surface layer during the spring time period.

It is driven by poorly understood processes occurring at the ice-ocean interface, such as subglacial discharge into the ocean, turbulent plume dynamics, submarine melting, and iceberg calving. These processes are (1) inherently interdisciplinary, requiring expertise in both glaciology and oceanography and (2) difficult to observe, requiring innovative field techniques and careful site selection. This project will address the relationship between subglacial discharge, turbulent plume dynamics, and submarine melting through a comprehensive field campaign at LeConte Glacier, Alaska, supplemented by a state-of-the-art modeling effort. The field site is ideal because it spans a wide range of forcings on daily to seasonal time scales and because the near-terminus fjord environment is accessible year round. A successful project will provide a unique data set and improved models for projecting contributions to future sea level rise.  This project will develop a parameterization of a plume, driven by subglacial discharge, as it interacts with the face of a marine-terminating glacier. This is a goal that has been endorsed by the international community. It will be accomplished by conducting three intensive field campaigns to  i. sample the upwelling plume directly with manned and autonomous vessels,  ii. measure the downstream impact of the plume on near-terminus fjord circulation,  iii. determine subglacial discharge and submarine melt rates, and  iv. survey associated changes in glacier terminus dynamics.  Subglacial discharge and ambient water properties in the proglacial fjord will be monitored throughout the project in order to provide  i. important context for the intensive field campaigns, and  ii. a range of parameter space to be explored by a turbulence-resolving hydrodynamic plume model.  Data from the intensive field campaigns will be used to validate the plume model, which will then be used to explore the wider range of parameter space that is provided by long-term measurements. The latter will allow investigation of the impact of submarine melting on glacier dynamics over seasonal timescales.",2017-11-14T08:00:00Z,2019-02-28T18:42:58Z

Jarvis Creek (634km2), which feeds the Delta and Tanana River in Interior Alaska, was studied as a proxy of the observed mountain glacier melting and permafrost degradation that has been documented across the Arctic region in recent decades. The specific objectives were to 1) assess the hydrologic fluxes (including streamflow source components), stores, pathways and the role of glacier wastage on watershed hydrology, through hydrologic and geochemical field measurements as well as numerical and statistical modeling; 2) quantify the effect of glaciers and permafrost on recent historical (1960-present) hydrologic fluxes and storage by combining remote sensing, field measurements of glacier mass balance, and hydrology with a heat- and mass transfer model, and 3) project the future hydrologic regime using custom-derived downscaled climate projections. 
	The purpose of this dataset was to refine our understanding of the recent historical and projected characteristics and controls of glacier mass balance, permafrost and water storage and fluxes. The dataset includes simulated results of glaciers, hydrology and soil temperatures at a 100m spatial and hourly (input) to monthly (output) temporal resolution. The simulated results are based upon a calibrated and validated version of the model that was informed by hourly time series of field measurements for forcing and model testing. Here, downscaled climate simulations using the WRF model and existing geospatial datasets informed the numerical glacier-permafrost-hydrology model. The hydrology model that was used was the Water balance Simulation Model (WaSiM) version 9.10.01 (www.wasim.ch).

Three August-September cruises, one every two years, were conducted, with extensive measurements along continental margins, a boundary current conduit; cruises covered vast areas from Svalbard to the East Siberian Sea. The program ties together oceanographic, chemical, and ice observations using moorings, repeated oceanographic sections, and Lagrangian drifters to provide vital information about Arctic Ocean changes. The overarching goal of the study as an AON element is to compile a cohesive picture of the state and transformations of Atlantic Water (AW) in the EMB, with particular focus on three major observational targets: (1) along-slope AW transport by the boundary currents (2) interaction of AW branches with shelf waters, deep basin interior and upper ocean (3) EMB indications of changes in the upper ocean circulation. The targets are broad in scope and pose a wide range of challenges to modern high-latitude observational oceanography. The EMB's size and location mean that this part of the Arctic Ocean is representative of pan-arctic conditions and processes, and therefore appropriate for long-term observing.

doi:10.18739/A2P26Q387,Leung Tsang,Modeled microwave properties of snow over sea ice at 17 and 37 gigahertz (GHz),NA,"The goals of this project are to model the microwave properties of snow over sea ice through High Performance Computing (HPC) three dimensional (3D) simulations of solutions of Maxwell equations and 3D simulations of snow microstructure. To apply the 3D simulation results to the analysis of active and passive microwave remote sensing data of snow over sea ice; and to design future microwave remote sensing measurements including signals of opportunities.  During the project period, we have developed techniques for 3D full wave numerical solutions of Maxwell equations (NMM3D) for snow over sea ice. We have applied the 3D simulation results to the analysis of active and passive microwave remote sensing data of snow and sea ice. We have generated Lookup Tables (LUTs) that relate different properties of snow and sea ice to brightness temperature (Tb) and backscatter responses with NMM3D. For passive remote sensing, we have generated LUTs of Tb at Ku (17 gigahertz) and Ka (37 gigahertz) band for retrieval of Snow Depth (SD) over sea ice with Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E/2) observations. For active remote sensing, LUTs of snow over sea ice at Ku and Ka band have been built. We also have built backscatter LUT for sea ice at L (1-2 gigahertz), C (4-8 gigahertz) and X (8-12 gigahertz) bands. In the 3D full wave simulations, the scattering matrix of the snowpack is directly obtained including both amplitude and phase. Both bistatic scattering coefficients and brightness temperatures (Tbs) of the snowpack are computed. Simulation results demonstrate backscattering enhancement effects and coherent layer effects which are missed in radiative transfer theory that only describes the incoherent wave interactions. We also found that the roughness of the snow/ice interface weakens the coherent layer effects. Our simulations also demonstrated that both Tb and backscattering are highly related to roughness of the snow/ice interface and the ice/water interface. The snow/ice interface roughness increases Tbs and backscatter more at high frequency and for thick ice, while the ice/water interface roughness increases Tbs and backscatter more at low frequency and for thin ice. Results from the numerical simulations were used to characterize signatures of microwave signals at different bands.  This dataset contains full model results in the included zip directory.

The rationale for holding the workshop derives from observations over the last decade of increased mass loss from the margins of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS). The widespread, regionally synchronous acceleration, and thinning of some of its major marine-terminating outlet glaciers point to a common climatic driver, consistent with the observed warming of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre and near-surface atmospheric warming. Detailed process understanding, however, is currently lacking. This hampers assessment of the impact of increased freshwater flux from the GrIS, not only on regional and global sea level, but also on the North Atlantic circulation and its effect on climate over the Atlantic sector. Specific meeting goals were:  1. Advancing the science, through improved communication, coordination, and collaboration between the diverse communities;  2. Establishment of the foundation for multidisciplinary efforts that will lead to deeper understanding of physical processes, better representation of these processes in climate models, and, consequently, more reliable projections of the Greenland Ice Sheet contribution to sea level;  3.

This project aims to develop the first system model to simulate the full chain of processes that control how weather and climate affect the processes that lead to deposition of a sediment record in lakes in glaciated watersheds. This model provides an alternative approach to previous statistically-based models traditionally used by paleo-climatologists to infer past climate variability from lake sediment records. The new process-based quantitative understanding will lay the groundwork for future studies that will be aimed at recovering records of environmental and climate change that extend back thousands of years.  This project will contribute to ongoing efforts through collaborations with: utility managers of the Municipality of Anchorage who are planning for diminished glacier meltwater input to Eklutna Lake, a major source of their electricity and freshwater and with resource managers at US Fish and Wildlife Service who are developing a monitoring network for the Arctic Refuge and who are striving to foresee future changes in habitat quality associated with glacier retreat.

Extending 1800 km between the North American and Asian continents, the Aleutian Islands divide the northern Pacific Ocean from the Bering Sea. Given their unique subpolar location, their genesis on a volcanically- and seismically-active plate boundary, and their gradual colonization by humans during the past 9000 years, the Aleutian Islands are an excellent natural archaeological laboratory for tracking past: (1) human ecology, (2) subarctic human-environmental reciprocal relationships and, (3) geological influences, sometimes catastrophic, on human society. Host to some of the world's most active volcanoes, the Four Mountains provided a superlative opportunity to assess the development of prehistoric human risk management of, and adaptations to, environmental instability (climate change, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, sea level fluctuations) through deep time. Four Mountain prehistoric sites are highly significant in light of new geologic data indicating volcanic activity during human migration and societal development in the Aleutians. Extensive new radiocarbon, paleoenvironmental, and cultural data extracted from these sites yielded novel insights into North Pacific Rim regional interactions, Unangan coping mechanisms, changing subsistence, and adaptations during the prehistoric and European contact periods. The primary research goals in the Four Mountains region was understanding: (1) how human cultures and behavior have been shaped by Holocene climatic, biotic and geologic change; and (2) how human cultures have used and impacted biotic environments. Researchers tested and documented: a) relationships of and interactions among human groups who peopled the Aleutians, b) long-term change in Holocene environments and consequent change in terrestrial and marine animal populations and diversity, much of which constituted human resources; c) human responses to shifts in the distribution, diversity, and abundance of resources and, d) human coping mechanisms and resilience in the face of potentially catastrophic climatic and geological forces.",2019-02-11T08:00:00Z,2019-02-11T23:01:33Z

The goals

                morphology, assemblages and the IP25 biomarker of ice-associated diatoms from a suite of over 200 surface sediments collected from the Bering and Chukchi Seas spanning 0-12 months/year of sea ice. The second goal is to apply sea ice reconstructions
                using the calibrated diatom assemblage methods and IP25 analysis to a suite of six archived cores that form a latitudinal transect through the Bering and Chukchi Seas. The PIs aim to quantitatively reconstruct Late Pleistocene and Holocene seasonal
                sea ice extent at centennial-scale resolution. These efforts will be corroborated with independent biomarker-based evaluation of surface water temperatures. The successful completion of the project will result in a rich, multi-proxy data set that

Many physical processes at a range of time and space scales determine this mass loss, but their relative roles in net loss or gain and trends are poorly understood. This project will investigate the physics of glacier-ocean interaction for a specific system, Petermann Gletscher (PG), using data to improve understanding of processes at the marine margin of PG that drains a large fraction of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) into a deep fjord connected to Nares Strait via a floating, up to 1800 feet thick, ice shelf. The ice shelf has undergone significant retreat in the last few years, from 80 km long in 2010 to 50 km today. Observations of warming of the deep water in Nares Strait and Petermann Fjord, and of ice-shelf thinning during the decade preceding retreat, lead to a hypothesis that increased basal melting contributes to loss of the ice shelf. The project is motivated by three aspects of the Petermann Gletscher and Fjord system: (1) its importance as a gateway for GIS mass loss; (2) comparison of ocean dynamics in Petermann Fjord with previously studied southern Greenland systems; and (3) the value of PG as a well-constrained system for studying processes that contribute to mass loss from other northern Greenland and Antarctic ice-shelf systems and their contribution to rising global sea level. The project takes advantage of recent observations of this system, including ongoing satellite-relayed data from sub-ice-shelf moorings.  This project would contribute to the development of a diverse STEM workforce through support for the training of two graduate and three undergraduate students, including a student from an under-represented group in STEM fields. The PI would continue his international collaborations with Swedish, English, and Canadian collaborators that were developed as part of the initial Petermann Gletscher study aboard I/B Oden in 2015. Outreach to the general public would be facilitated through the PI?s website, blog, occasional media interviews, and embedding national print journalists in the field work.  Time series analyses will characterize how sub-glacial waters change along the central melt channel with the tides and seasons. Description of the average state and interpretation of variations will be aided by ocean survey data properties collected in the adjacent ocean by ship between 2003 and 2015. Both time- and frequency-domain statistical analyses will reveal correlation time and space scales. More specifically, Fourier, wavelet, and Hilbert transforms will be used to provide estimates of amplitude and phase at discrete scales. Frequency-domain linear system analyses will reveal input-output relations between multiple time series that represent forcings (e.g., atmospheric temperature and wind stress when sea-ice is mobile or absent, tides) and responses (e.g., depth of surface mixed layer, heat content of the meltwater plume, ice velocity and basal melt rate). Analyses of data from GPS and pressure sensors at each mooring will determine the degree of floatation at each site as the glacier transitions from >365 m to <100 m in thickness. Summer ocean surveys describe the inflowing Atlantic waters that will become diluted by basal melt and by direct injection of freshwater. Thermodynamic constraints on the solid-to-fluid phase transition of glacier ice melted by the ocean result in a characteristic relation of ocean temperatures and salinity (the Gade-line), which is set by the latent heat of melting. A second mixing line arises from ice-shelf surface melting and direct runoff into the fjord. In some fjord systems, this component includes a substantial discharge of subglacial water generated upstream of the grounding line. The proposed temperature-salinity analyses will reveal the importance of this sub-glacial freshwater source along the central melt-channel.",2019-01-01T08:00:00Z,2019-09-17T18:17:02Z

The data documenting the importance of these ecosystem ""hotspots"" provide a growing marine time-series from the northern Bering Sea to Barrow Canyon at the boundary of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas. Results from these studies show spatial changes in carbon production and export to the sediments as indicated by infaunal community composition and biomass, shifts in sediment grain size on a S-to-N latitudinal gradient, and range extensions for lower trophic levels and further northward migration of higher trophic organisms, such as gray whales. There is also direct evidence of negative impacts on ice dependent species, such as walruses and polar bears. To more systematically track the broad biological response to sea ice retreat and associated environmental change, an international consortium of scientists are developing a coordinated Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) that includes selected biological measurements at multiple trophic levels. These measurements are being made simulataneously with hydrographic surveys and satellite observations. The DBO currently focuses on five regional biological ""hotspot"" locations along a latitudinal gradient. The spatially explicit DBO network is being organized through the Pacific Arctic Group (PAG), a consensus-driven, international collaboration sanctioned by the International Arctic Science Committee.

Several homes and structures have been relocated as a result of erosion. There had been some unsuccessful (early) attempts to slow erosion in Huslia, but nothing in recent years."" Residents of Huslia indicated both in the Community Plan (1) and in personal discussions with the principal investigators that erosion was one of the most serious problems affecting the village, with strong counter-indications for community development, health and wellness, and small business entrepreneurship.  The issue of erosion has reached such a point that the Hazard Mitigation Plan (2) was created. During the conversation scheduling National Science Foundation workshop logistics, this high resolution aerial video capture was requested by Carl Burgett, First Chief of Huslia, in order to better share the significant impact of erosion on the region with the broader research community in the hopes of justifying granting agency funding for restoration efforts enhancing safety, economic development, reconstruction, transportation and shipping efforts.  1) Huslia Community Plan https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/dcra/DCRARepoExt/RepoPubs/Plans/HusliaCommunityPlan2017.pdf  2) Huslia Hazard Mitigation Plan https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/dcra/DCRARepoExt/RepoPubs/Plans/Huslia_HMP_2018_Update_8-22-18_Final_Plan.pdf",2019-06-20T07:00:00Z,2019-09-25T18:50:04Z

However, while ongoing climate warming and permafrost thaw are expected to increase plant productivity (CO2 uptake), continued warming is also expected to weaken prior constraints on decomposition (CO2 emissions). The net effect of these changes on the Arctic's carbon budget and the global climate system are poorly understood, as most observations have been made during the short growing season, when root and rhizosphere respiration dominate CO2 emissions. This project will focus on the development of a new technology for the continuous collection of CO2 emitted from arctic tundra soils. This passive diffusive sieve (zeolite) trap for measuring soil respired CO2 will be rugged, small, lightweight, low-cost, and require little in the way of power (batteries) low power. It has the potential to transform our understanding of carbon cycling in the Arctic, as it allows for the year-round CO2 collection, including during the winter and shoulder seasons when sites are often inaccessible, and over multiple weeks (3 weeks/sample), thus integrating both diffusive and episodic emissions. Outreach activities will strengthen the existing NSF-supported K-12 training programs at UC Irvine that are aimed to increase the participation of underprivileged populations in the STEM fields. The Investigators will engage middle school students with lab tours and activities during a ""Day at College""-experience and class room visits. The project will also train a graduate student, and contribute to educating researchers (via an international summer course) in the use of 14C analysis in Ecology and Earth System Science.  The investigators will develop and deploy a novel system to continuously trap CO2 emitted from arctic tundra soils over several weeks for radiocarbon (14C) analysis. However, typical canister-based systems for measuring soil respired CO2, can be relatively large, expensive to ship, and require line power. This project will develop and deploy a novel system to continuously trap CO2 emitted from Arctic tundra soils over several weeks for radiocarbon (14C) analysis. This continuous collection system has the potential to transform carbon cycle research. Such devices would obviate the need for shipping large canisters to the Arctic as well and the need for line power. Moreover, such devices are relatively inexpensive and lightweight, and therefore, permit for high spatial resolution monitoring. These new traps, however, have never been tested in the Arctic, where the environmental conditions can be harsh, especially in winter. Thus the focus of this work is to develop, harden, and test such devices through a number of winter seasons at the Toolik Lake Long Term Ecological Station, on the north slope of Alaska. If successful, this device will provide the first year-round, quasi-continuous data set on soil-respired 14CO2 in moist acidic tussock tundra, which is the dominant tundra type of arctic Alaska and globally accounts for over 20% of the tundra land surface. Moreover, this research will point the way for other experimental groups working in similar harsh environments throughout the Arctic.",2018-01-01T08:00:00Z,2019-01-31T17:50:17Z

Concurrent with this sea ice loss, the Greenland ice sheet has been losing mass recently, with increased surface melt and discharge rates. These changes are of great socioeconomic concern as continued negative trends in the extent of floating sea ice cover and ice sheet mass are likely to have widespread impacts on climate and global sea levels. The investigators propose that the simultaneous decreases in sea ice cover and increased melting of the Greenland ice sheet are connected. On the one hand, both may be largely responding to the same forcing to some degree, such as a generalized warming signal, amplified over the Arctic. On the other hand, it can be hypothesized that sea ice variability, through influences on mixed ocean layer temperatures, overlying air temperatures, column water vapor and atmospheric circulation, influences Greenland ice sheet surface melt and accumulation. Through a combination of data analysis, process studies and modeling, this project seeks to define the interactions between sea ice loss and Greenland ice sheet melt and accumulation. The following major research questions provide a framework for the study: 1) Does sea ice variability influence Greenland ice sheet surface melt (where, when, and how)? 2) What is the nature of storm activity around Greenland in the context of ice and ocean conditions and how might changes in the marine environment influence Greenland surface melt and accumulation in the future? This investigation will take advantage of up-to-date satellite sensor data, in combination with several new atmospheric reanalysis data products, station data and a state-of-the-art regional climate model, performed by a research team who are specialists in regional climate modeling, analysis of geospatial and sequential data analysis, satellite remote sensing and hydroclimatology in the Arctic and Greenland. This project will support students at the University of Colorado, the City College of New York and Rutgers University.

The model requires meteorological inputs including air temperature, humidity, wind speed, surface shortwave radiation, surface longwave radiation, surface pressure, precipitation, and basin runoff. A number of lake-specific parameters (e.g., depth, salinity, surface albedo) allow this model to simulate lakes in diverse climates and physical settings. The source code is written in Fortran 90 and may be compiled with open-source compilers such as gfortran.",2018-01-01T08:00:00Z,2019-01-09T18:25:48Z

This dataset contains data collected mostly around outlet glaciers in Greenland, including a large grid at Jakobshavn, with the specific purpose of improving understanding in this dynamic and fast changing part of the ice sheet. Using this radar dataset, various manual and semi-automated techniques are used to track the ice surface and ice bottom in the echogram data products. The ice surface and ice bottom are stored in Mathworks MATLAB format files. When the ice surface and ice bottom could not be tracked because the imagery was not good enough, the values are replaced with a not-a-number (“NaN”).

A growing body of work shows the atmospheric response is sensitive to the location of the sea ice anomalies, with the Barents-Kara Seas (BKS) implicated as a partiuclarly important forcing region. Mechanistically, sea ice loss corresponds to warm temperature anomalies, altered surface potential vorticity gradients, and therefore changes in rossby wave dynamics. This Rossby wave forcing is hypothesized to impact midlatitude surface weather either directly by changing synoptic weather patterns or indirectly via propagation into the stratosphere and subsequent downward control. While fall sea ice is declining, fall Siberian snow cover has increased. Variability in fall Siberian snow extent during has also been implicated as a potential driver of northern hemisphere winter weather through its influence on surface heating patterns and subsequent modulation of the Arctic Oscillation. As with sea ice forcing, snow forcing is hypothesized to act via the vertical propagation of waves into the stratosphere. The purpose of this model simulation was to investigate the impact of combined Fall Arctic Sea Ice and Eurasion snow perturbations",2019-01-01T08:00:00Z,2019-02-20T17:31:16Z

Vitzthum,Testing Genotype-Hormone Associations in Circumpolar Ancestral and Descendant Populations,NA,"This project produced novel findings regarding the association between genotype and human fertility, advanced new methods for studying hormonal and genotypic variation, and contributed the groundwork for subsequent research on the environmental, behavioral, and genetic determinants of reproductive hormone concentrations in arctic women. Individual differences in fertility are partly dependent upon a woman's reproductive hormone levels during her menstrual cycle. These hormone concentrations are also risk factors for several diseases (e.g., breast and other cancers, cardiovascular disease).  Despite the significant roles of these hormones in women's health, very little is known about the extent and causes of variation in these hormones among pre-menopausal arctic women. 
                                     
                                     
                                     This project examined whether genetic variation contributes to differences in fertility and hormonal variation in circumpolar ancestral (Central Asian) and descendant (indigenous South American) populations, and between former East and West German women. The specific characteristics of each of these population made them particularly suitable choices for this study. Contemporary Germany is very similar to the U.S. but had been divided for about 40 years into two separate countries with different lifestyles.  Thus, Germany is both a good model for understanding hormonal variation in the U.S. population, and also allows a comparison of the effects of the different lifestyles on hormone concentrations in these genetically comparable German samples. Likewise, the Bolivian Aymara and Central Asian populations are genetically similar because of their shared ancestry with circumpolar populations, but their different lifestyles and environments are likely to influence hormone concentrations.

This variant is in a gene that encodes a protein thought to be involved in centrosomal or ciliary functions. Mutations in this gene also cause Leber congenital amaurosis type V, a syndrome including congenital blindness.

Since 1972, NIC has produced Arctic and Antarctic sea ice charts. This data set is an Arctic sea ice concentration climatology derived from the NIC weekly or biweekly operational ice chart time series. The charts used in the climatology are from 1972 through 2004, and the monthly climatology products are median, maximum, minimum, first quartile, and third quartile concentrations, as well as frequency of occurrence of ice at any concentration for 33 year, 10 year, and 5 year periods.

NIC charts are produced through the analyses of available in situ, remote sensing, and model data sources. They are generated primarily for mission planning and safety of navigation. NIC charts generally show more ice than do passive microwave derived sea ice concentrations, particularly in the summer when passive microwave algorithms tend to underestimate ice concentration.

However, this can be complicated because these temperatures are related to both changing meteorology (e.g., air temperature and precipitation) and hydrology (e.g., instream flows and lateral inflows). The ability to predict climate related changes on instream thermal regimes in Arctic streams is limited by the minimal understanding of key processes and the availability of data to quantify heat fluxes. We hypothesized that the dominant heat fluxes within Arctic streams are similar to those in temperate climates but that the relative magnitude of the heat fluxes differ, and that quantification of lateral inflows is key in predicting water temperatures. We first found that temperate-zone and Arctic river temperatures are controlled by similar processes, with a few key differences. The differences, however, depended on location within the watershed and hydrologic condition. In general, solar radiation and other radiative exchanges controlled river temperatures at the most downstream and upstream locations in the watershed. However, there were other key heat fluxes in the upper locations that varied with instream flows. During large rain events and high river flows, the relatively steep terrain in the upper portion of the watershed delivers water efficiently and surface and groundwater inflows from the watershed become an important control on river temperatures (See King et al., 2016 Water Resources Research, doi:10.1002/2015WR017965 for more information). During dry periods when the river flow is low, we found that the exchange of water from the channel to the cold river bottom sediments and back became important and kept the river temperatures cool enough for fish (See King et al., 2019 Water Resources Research, for more information).

Parks Canada provided Kaplan the vessel, its crew, and polar bear monitors free of charge to accomplish the project. The goal of the fieldwork was to assess the stability of a Middle Dorset (800 CE to 1,000 CE; CE meaning Common Era or the equivalent of 1,216 years ago to 1,016 years ago as of the present date: 2016 CE) archaeological site (Avayalik-1, House 1), located on an outer island 25 miles south of the tip of Labrador. Researchers investigated the vulnerability of Avayalik-1 to rising sea levels and the thawing of permafrost, with the intention of contributing to discussions on how to assess, monitor, and preserve such sites. This information is of great interest to the scientific community, culture resource managers, and also to the indigenous residents who are in many cases the decedents of the original occupants.  Avayalik-1, House 1 is a scientifically unique Middle Dorset site. It was last investigated in 1978, and yielded organic artifacts and faunal remains unsurpassed in quantity and preservation by any other Labrador Middle Dorset sites due to the fact the cultural deposits were permanently frozen. However, given the current warming of the Arctic and the rapid thawing of permafrost, many Arctic heritage sites thought for decades to be safe while in the frozen ground are under threat. Avayalik-1 is such a site.  The dataset contains specific archaeology site locations, photographs, fieldnotes, and an archaeology collection inventory. The information is being used to assess the stability of Avayalik-1, a Paleoeskimo site of importance to understanding the prehistory of Labrador, Canada. According to the terms of the research permit, the data collected must be deposited with Parks Canada, the archaeology office of the Province of Labrador-Newfoundland, and Nunatsiavut Archaeology Office. The data can be accessed through those repositories only, for Canada considers exact locations and the contents of archaeological sites protected information.

The project documented and evaluated a range of ongoing efforts to revitalize Itelmen and analyzed the effectiveness of the existing language revitalization tools and programs. This research was conducted in order to contribute to a deeper understanding of language and cultural revitalization programs not only among Itelmens of Kamchatka, but also with the purpose to inform about these programs world-wide. The preservation of this language in the face of centuries of assimilation programs enacted by Russian Imperial and later Soviet administrations is significant. The most significant broader impact is what other Indigenous communities in a similar situation to the Itelmen can learn from this community's struggles and efforts as well as what Itelmens can learn from other communities that are struggling to save their language. 

Researchers on this project aimed to understand which methods should be applied for a successful Itelmen language revitalization program both in class and outside the classroom. When this research started in 2013 there were about nine speakers who were growing up speaking Itelmen as their first language. By the end of the study in 2016 only four speakers remained. 


In Kamchatka the student researcher visited five different locations. Each has its own specifics. 

Part of the research was dedicated to the use of multimedia in language revitalization. The main outcome of this part of the project was the publication of the DVD of Itelmen traditional and contemporary songs with subtitles and video Xaƚc mǝncaⱪa’ƚkicen (Let's sing). The idea was borrowed from the widely known Karaoke. Each song has a voice of the native speaker singing the song, visualized by subtitles in Itelmen and Russian, and video. 

This research indicated that Itelmens are ready to be active in bringing their language back to the active life, however there is a great lack of knowledge about the language immersion methodologies and other techniques that go beyond the educational setting of schools.",2017-07-19T07:00:00Z,2017-07-21T20:47:43Z

doi:10.18739/A2F76665G,Shantenu Jha,Report of the NSF Workshop on High‐Performance Distributed Computing and Polar Sciences,"high-performance computing, polar science","Climate change in the 20th and 21st century is dramatically changing the polar regions. This is documented by numerous studies, for example as thawing permafrost, retreating Arctic sea ice and accelerating mass loss from glaciers and ice sheets. These changes may have widespread consequences for many aspects of the earth systems, e.g. carbon budget, food and water security, sea levels, and freshwater input to oceans. To understand the changing polar regions and their global impacts, scientists are increasingly using very large datasets derived from high‐resolution satellite imagery, airborne missions, and computer modeling. However, advanced cyberinfrastructure, and in particular, high‐performance distributed computing (HPDC) remains an underutilized resource within the polar science community.  To explore the opportunities for addressing this gap and increasing the collaboration between the polar science and HPDC communities, the workshop ""High‐Performance & Distributed Computing for Polar Sciences: Applications, Cyberinfrastructure and Opportunities"" brought together polar scientists, HPDC experts, and data practitioners at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey on December 4 and 5, 2014. Approximately thirty U.S.‐based researchers gathered for two days of presentations and discussions centered on two questions:
1) How can polar science benefit from HPDC? and 2) What are the challenges in bringing HPDC and polar sciences together?  Through workshop discussions, participants agreed that processing the ever‐expanding catalog of high‐resolution digital satellite imagery, and running model simulations of polar region dynamics, provide key opportunities for polar science and HPDC collaboration to advance both fields. Despite the potential of these opportunities, a number of challenges currently exist preventing progress. Some example obstacles to collaboration are the knowledge gap, simple access mechanisms to HPDC resources and lower barriers to access HPDC.  Workshop participants discussed many ways to close this gap, inter alia including how to increase data discovery and make connections between data repositories with computing and data processing facilities. Articulating and addressing the heterogeneity of HPDC solutions, whilst improving the simplicity of HPDC resource use (and understanding) were recurring themes. Greater adoption of HPDC might be facilitated by making software products commonly used among polar scientists available on HPDC platforms. Additionally, there are socio‐technical and cultural barriers that need addressing.  Participants found the workshop, with adequate time for discussions, very educational and helpful, and there was unanimous consensus that such efforts needed to be sustained in order to understand how to convert aspirations into a plan and subsequent action. Recommendations from the Workshop include the following:  • Continue cross‐community engagement to build common directions  • Promote awareness of HPDC training resources for polar scientists  • Work towards a roadmap for HPDC uptake in the polar sciences",2017-03-08T08:00:00Z,2018-07-02T19:43:32Z

Beginning in the early 1940s, increasing Pb concentration at Eclipse Icefield occurs coevally with anthropogenic Pb deposition in central Greenland, suggesting that North American Pb pollution may have been in part or wholly responsible in both regions. Isotopic ratios (208Pb/207Pb and 206Pb/207Pb) from 1970 to 2001 confirm that a portion of the Pb deposited at Eclipse Icefield is anthropogenic, and that it represents a variable mixture of East Asian (Chinese and Japanese) emissions transported eastward across the Pacific Ocean and a North American component resulting from transient meridional atmospheric flow. Based on comparison with source material Pb isotope ratios, Chinese and North American coal combustion have likely been the primary sources of Eclipse Icefield Pb over the 1970–2001 time period. The Eclipse Icefield Pb isotope composition also implies that the North Pacific mid‐troposphere is not directly impacted by transpolar atmospheric flow from Europe. Annually averaged Pb concentrations in the Eclipse Icefield ice core record show no long‐term trend during 1970–2001; however, increasing208Pb/207Pb and decreasing 206Pb/207Pb ratios reflect the progressive East Asian industrialization and increase in Asian pollutant outflow. The post‐1970 decrease in North American Pb emissions is likely necessary to explain the Eclipse Icefield Pb concentration time series. When compared with low (lichen) and high (Mt. Logan ice core) elevation Pb data, the Eclipse ice core record suggests a gradual increase in pollutant deposition and stronger trans‐Pacific Asian contribution with rising elevation in the mountains of the North Pacific rim.",2012-01-01T08:00:00Z,2018-09-27T15:28:05Z

The U.S. National Ice Center (NIC) is an inter-agency sea ice analysis and forecasting center comprised of Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Defense/U.S. Navy, and Department of Homeland Security/U.S. Coast Guard components. Since 1972, NIC has produced Arctic and Antarctic sea ice charts. This data set is an Arctic sea ice concentration climatology derived from the NIC weekly or biweekly operational ice chart time series. The charts used in the climatology are from 1972 through 2004, and the monthly climatology products are median, maximum, minimum, first quartile, and third quartile concentrations, as well as frequency of occurrence of ice at any concentration for 33 year, 10 year, and 5 year periods. These climatologies and the charts from which they are derived are provided in 25 km EASE-Grid (Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid /gridded binary). Ice extent can be derived from concentration by summing the number of equal area EASE-Grid cells. GIF browse files are also provided. The climatologies are also made available in a Geographical Information System (GIS) compatible format. NIC charts are produced through the analyses of available in situ, remote sensing, and model data sources. They are generated primarily for mission planning and safety of navigation. NIC charts generally show more ice than do passive microwave derived sea ice concentrations, particularly in the summer when passive microwave algorithms tend to underestimate ice concentration. The record of sea ice concentration from the NIC series is believed to be more accurate than that from passive microwave sensors, especially from the mid-1990s on (see references in the documentation), but it lacks the consistency of some passive microwave time series.",2009-11-18T08:00:00Z,2016-09-21T23:25:40Z

The intellectual merit of the project is that these analyses, combined with others, will take advantage of the high snow accumulation WAIS Divide site yielding the highest time resolution glacio-biogeochemical and gas record of any deep Antarctic ice core. With other high resolution Greenland cores (GISP2 and GRIP) and lower resolution Antarctic cores, the combined record will yield new insights into worldwide climate dynamics and abrupt change. The proposed chemical, biological, and elemental tracer measurements will also be used to address all of the WAIS Divide science themes. The broader impacts of the project include education and outreach activities such as numerous presentations to local K-12 students; opportunities for student and teacher involvement in the laboratory work; a teacher training program in Earth sciences in the heavily minority Santa Ana, Compton, and Costa Mesa, California school districts; and development of high school curricula. Extensive graduate and undergraduate student involvement also is planned and will include one post doctoral associate, one graduate student, and undergraduate hourly involvement at DRI; a graduate student and undergraduates at University of California, Irvine (UCI); and a post doctoral fellow at MSU.

doi:10.18739/A22F7JR5T,Liam Frink,Ethnoarchaeological investigation of the Yup´ik seal poke storage,Alaska,"This proposal seeks funding to conduct ethnoarchaeological research of the Native Alaskan
seal poke storage system. The seal poke storage system is a highly innovative and efficient subsistence
technique and yet no scholarly research has been devoted it. The primary goal of this study is to document
how the pokes and storing facilities are manufactured and used and the health implications of changes in
the storage of traditional foods. This is important to better identify and model storage facilities in the
archaeological record as well as potential health implications of contemporary storage techniques.
Though one of the most important aspects of adaptation in the Arctic is food storage, little attention has
been paid to 1) how people store their foods 2) how and why storage techniques and materials change
over time, and 3) the health implications of changed storage practices and technology. The seal poke
system was an ingenious storage technology whole seal skins wherein dried fish were stored and seal fat
was rendered into oil. However, today coastal people often store their oil in plastic buckets. This research
will document how the pokes are made and used and the possible effects that traditional storing and
processing methods in this region may have had on the quality of foods. To address these issues, this
project uses a broad-based methodology, a proven research approach the PI has implemented in Yup´ik
communities in southwestern Alaska since 1996, which integrates the collection of field data and in this
study medical anthropology and laboratory food analysis. Data will be drawn from research in Tununak,
Alaska with Yup´ik women and men who have used this storage system in their lifetimes as a critical
subsistence strategy that will be lost after this elder generation. This project will record the building of a
seal poke storage facility, 2 seal pokes, monitor the use and contents of the pokes over a 2 year period,
and will collect qualitative interview data about the system. The quantitative nutritional evaluation of the
seal poke oil will be compared with samples from 3 families who will keep their oil in plastic buckets.",2016-10-17T07:00:00Z,2020-05-19T18:24:39Z

However, material shed from continents is preserved as marine sediment that can be analyzed to infer glacial process and history. Here, we use measurements of in situ produced cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al in marine sediment cores to understand the long-term behavior of the eastern Greenland Ice Sheet. We find a progressive, order-of-magnitude decline in 10Be over the past 7.5 Myr, consistent with deep, ongoing erosion by ice of the pre-icehouse Greenlandic landscape. 26Al/10Be indicates that much of East Greenland was covered by ice for most of the Pleistocene. At major climate transitions, isotope concentrations and 26Al/10Be change, consistent with ice sheet expansion into previously ice-free terrain. The detrital cosmogenic history reflects major events recorded in the marine benthic δ18O record, confirming that the Greenland Ice Sheet consistently responded to global climate forcing.",2016-11-13T08:00:00Z,2020-05-19T18:56:28Z

Samples were collected in late 2012 on cruise ARK-XXII/3 on the RV Polarstern. Snow has been suggested to be an effective scavenger of PFAS in the atmosphere 41 and an evidence for a primary source of PFAA to the Arctic via atmospheric oxidation of volatile precursors. More PFASs (C11 PFCA, FOSA, and EtFOSAA) were detected in melt pond water and snow samples when compared to those of water samples collected from the Arctic shelf and Ocean. Samples were collected from mostly first year ice, integrating PFAS deposition from up to one year. In the present investigation, the snow samples showed detectable concentrations of PFCAs (C6-C12), PFSAs (C8 and C10), MeFOSAA, EtFOSAA and FOSA (Figure 3). Concentrations were similar or greater to previously reported for the Devon ice cap (Young et al., 2007). Relatively high total PFAS concentration was observed in Station 5 - PS80/323 (1.60 ng/L; Station 1: 0.298 ng/L and Station 8: 0.368 ng/L). For all PFASs, there were stronger correlations between concentration and degree longitude, rather than degree latitude. Regressions versus longitude were significant (p&amp;lt;0.10) for PFHxA and PFNA, and at p&amp;lt; 0.20 for PFOA and PFOS. PFAS concentrations increased as samples were taken further east.

policy, Pribilof Islands, Alaska, 2015",ethnography place-making fisheries management Indigenous communities economic development fisheries coastal communities social and economic models,"This project describes how relational place-making, with its focus on power dynamics, networked politics, and non-market, locally-valued characteristics, provides a useful framework for managers to better design fishing community policies. Social data, while becoming more common in fisheries management analyses, are typically restricted to quantitative measures that often cannot adequately summarize dynamics within fishing communities. In contrast, detailed ethnographic research and the theoretical framework of relational place-making can provide a useful methodology through which to gather social data to understand resource-dependent communities and the effects of fisheries management policies in these places. Relational place-making describes the process through which physical spaces are transformed into socially meaningful places, and how these understandings are contested and negotiated among different groups of actors. These contested narratives of place, called place-frames, can interact with economic development efforts to help create (or fail to create) sustainable communities. To better understand the efficacy of a specific fisheries policy, the community development quota (CDQ) program, we conducted 6 months of ethnographic research in the rural, Native communities of St. George and St. Paul, Alaska. In both communities we found that local place-frames centered on local empowerment and control. In St. George, local place-frames conflicted with place-frames advanced by CDQ employees, and locals were unable to align place-making goals with local economic realities. In St. Paul, local residents and CDQ employees shared a place-frame, allowing them to accomplish numerous local development goals. However, differences in place-frames advanced by other political entities on the island often complicated development initiatives. This study supports previous research indicating that policies and development projects that increase local power and self-determination are most successful in furthering community sustainability and well-being. This study indicates that relational place-making can illuminate local goals and desires and is therefore of great utility to the fisheries management decision-making process.

This study also adds to current efforts at assessing the vulnerability of fishing communities. Typically these assessments center around the creation of quantitative indices. The quantification of social data, however, has several drawbacks. These include the loss of detail, removal of historical context, and obscuring of power dynamics. The Means, Meanings, and Contexts (MMC) Framework is presented as an alternative methodology, one that allows for the integration of qualitative social science into the understanding of community vulnerability, drawing upon ethnographic research techniques and theories of place-making. Place-making refers to the changing relationships between the physical support offered by a landscape (means), and the relationships among place, people, and lifestyle in a community (meanings). To adequately assess community vulnerability, researchers can collect data on both means and meanings within a community. Using these data, community vulnerability is assessed by responding to a series of 12 broad prompts. Responses to these prompts are summarized at three levels of detail: detailed textual description, tabular summary, and graphical summary. Using the Pribilof Island communities of St. George and St. Paul, Alaska as examples, this framework indicates that St. George is a highly vulnerable community, while St. Paul is moderately vulnerable. These results are in stark contrast with quantitative assessments of community vulnerability, which indicate that St. George is a low to moderately vulnerable community, while St. Paul is a highly vulnerable community. Tools like the MMC Framework, therefore, help make a place for important, but complex, qualitative social data, in fisheries management.

This pilot study demonstrates the potential for interactively mapping, visualizing, and labeling glacier changes. What is truly innovative is that IceTrendr not only maps the changes but also uses expert knowledge to label the changes and such labels can be applied to other glaciers exhibiting statistically similar changes. This is much more than just a simple ""then and now"" approach to glacier mapping.  IceTrendr is a means of integrating the power of computing, remote sensing, and expert knowledge to ""tell the story"" of glacier changes.

Our key findings are that the IceTrendr concept and software can provide important functionality for glaciologists and educators interested in studying glacier changes during the Landsat TM timeframe (1984-present). With additional time and funding, there is the exciting and innovative opportunity to build on the IceTrendr framework, to develop much greater utility for mapping glaciers and characterizing glacier change globally. Although this pilot study focused on just five glaciers, with some future funding and effort, IceTrendr will have the potential to map changing glaciers EVERYWHERE over the full Landsat TM timeframe (1984-present). Specifically, concerns with the Landsat TM imagery are that many images are missing during the period 1984-1995 and the automated cloud mask is not effective requiring the user to manually identify cloud-free images. We found that the visualization of the glacier in the IceTrendr window worked well with high-resolution satellite data from Google Earth and visualization was improved with additional high-resolution images from the Polar Geospatial Center. The automated clustering algorithm was a good first step in glacier mapping and when augmented with glacier outlines from the Randall Glacier Inventory, users could readily see changes in glacier extent, brightness, debris cover, as well as changes in surrounding area including glacial lakes and rivers, vegetation, and moraines.",2017-06-21T07:00:00Z,2020-05-19T22:53:37Z

under-ice water samples for calibrating the OsmoSampler methane, ion, and microbiology data.  The goal of the annual OsmoSampler deployments from August 2015 is to capture of a
continuous annual record of lake biogeochemistry, including under ice cover, to determine the
source, cycling, and fate of methane in these Canadian Arctic lakes. To this end, each
OsmoSampler system contains three different samplers, as well as a suite of sensors. The three
samplers are for methane (""CH4""), major/minor/trace elements (""Acid""), and microbial
community composition (""BOSS""). The sensor suite includes one sensor for dissolved oxygen

continuously throughout the Arctic winter using autonomous sampling devices, to more thoroughly address
            the variability in the methane flux from Arctic lakes to the atmosphere. Methane is a potent
            greenhouse gas, the release of which from Arctic sources is poised to increase with climate
            warming. This project will expand upon a successful pilot study that included the initial testing
            of autonomous continuous fluid sampler and sensor systems. The proposed expansion will
            involve additional capabilities and the deployment of a sampling unit in each of six small lakes
            along a north-south gradient in the Mackenzie River delta in the Canadian Arctic for a ninemonth
            period, spanning the winter season. With these data the investigators aim to characterize
            the physical, chemical, and microbial conditions in the water column to elucidate hydrologic,
            microbial, and weathering processes during the winter season, when methane builds in lake
            water under the ice cover. The investigators hypothesize that sudden (week, days, or even hours)
            releases of methane, following spring flooding and ice cover breakup, produce a distinct
            atmospheric flux from Arctic lakes that would otherwise be missed, since most logistically
            reasonable sampling occurs in the summer months when methane concentrations in these lakes
            are low or below detection.  The majority of methane flux to the Arctic atmosphere is estimated to come from soils and small
            lakes, although these estimates are based on few direct observations with large uncertainties.
            This proposed study, using in situ samplers and sensors, will allow an extensive microbial, gas
            and ion analytical program coupled with a network of physical and chemical sensor data to
            assess temporal conditions during winter months; to confirm fundamental processes and rates; to
            determine the interplay among microbial, geochemical and physical processes; and to develop a
            plan for a more inclusive study that takes advantage of low cost proxies for significant processes
            that best characterize temporal aspects of lake conditions. The project will enhance infrastructure
            for future research in the Arctic through the development of novel in situ sampling. The project

The FLASH research had two primary purposes: first, to locate, date, and to the extent possible, characterize the nature of the activities performed at the fornbyli locations; and second, to describe and understand the sequences of soil erosion, sediment deposition, and landscape change that have occurred on Hegranes, both near and distant from the fornbyli sites and the major farms, since the settlement of Iceland ca. 870 AD. Coring was employed by FLASH and SCASS to (1) determine the establishment date and extent of the medieval settlements and farmsteads; (2) locate areas of human activity and measure soil depth in the fields immediately surrounding the medieval settlements; and (3) determine the dates, use, and environmental context of fornbyli sites.

Preliminary interpretations of the work suggest that many fornbyli were inhabited early, that the sites were reused after habitation ceased for multiple purposes through the medieval period and later, and that the overall landscape of Hegranes has been subject to significant erosion and alteration over the course of its history. Most of the fornbyli were inhabited prior to ca. 950 AD, and several of them were relatively large during the 10th and 11th centuries, comparable in size to farms that would later become much larger and more successful. Others seem only to have been inhabited for a short time, perhaps as a temporary or seasonal work site. None show evidence of habitation much after ca. 1104, and from that time until after the late 18th century, many of the sites were rebuilt as farm infrastructure for livestock management, only to be finally abandoned and fall to ruin before the 20th century. Preliminary environmental analysis suggests two significant periods of erosion: prior to 1104, and after 1766, roughly corresponding to the periods when the use of the sites was changing. The relationship between mire development and site use will be further investigated in 2017, along with the character and timing of habitation at the remaining sites.",2017-11-07T08:00:00Z,2020-05-21T20:23:40Z

The work was performed to meet the goals of the Skagafjordur Church and Settlement Survey (SCASS) and for Kathryn Catlin's doctoral dissertation research towards her PhD at Northwestern University.

The FLASH research had two primary purposes: first, to locate, date, and to the extent possible, characterize the nature of the activities performed at the fornbyli locations; and second, to describe and understand the sequences of soil erosion and sediment deposition that have occurred on Hegranes, both near and distant from the fornbyli and the major farms, since the settlement of Iceland ca. 870 AD.

Coring was performed at all seven farms with multiple objectives for both projects. At Keflavik, As, and Keldudalur, coring was employed to (1) determine the establishment date and extent of the medieval farm mounds near the farmstead center; (2) locate areas of human activity and measure soil depth in the fields immediately surrounding the medieval farm mounds; and (3) determine the dates, use, and environmental context of fornbyli at the margins of the modern farms. At Gardur and Hroarsdalur, coring concentrated on (1) the farm mounds and (2) the extensive nearby fields. At Egg and Helluland, coring was only undertaken at (3) two of the fornbyli. This document reports on (2) extensive field coring and (3) coring at the fornbyli. (1) Coring and excavations in the farm mounds fell under the purview of the main SCASS project and are reported elsewhere. Test pits at Minni-As and Tunfotur (on As) targeted the oldest locations of ash middens as determined from coring survey, and additional profiles at Minni-As and Thraelagerdi (on Keflavik) were placed to characterize erosion at a distance from human habitation. Limited finds (primarily faunals) were retrieved. Macrobotanical flotation samples were obtained from all pre-1300 contexts, along with radiocarbon samples when feasible.

Preliminary interpretations of the work suggest that many fornbyli were constructed early and reused for multiple purposes through the medieval period and later, and that the overall landscape of Hegranes has been subject to significant erosion and landscape change over the course of its history. In particular, the timing of transitions from well-drained to boggy soils in low-lying areas will be investigated in 2016 and 2017.",2017-11-07T08:00:00Z,2020-05-21T20:23:49Z
doi:10.18739/A21G0HV6M,John Tarduno,A Large Ornithurine Bird (Tingmiatornis arctica) from the Turonian High Arctic: Climatic and Evolutionary Implications,Arctic Paleoclimate Ornithurine Cretaceous evolution,"Bird fossils from Turonian (ca. 90Ma) sediments of Axel Heiberg Island (High Canadian Arctic) are among the earliest North American records. The morphology of a large well-preserved humerus supports identification of a new volant, possibly diving, ornithurine species (Tingmiatornis arctica). The new bird fossils are part of a freshwater vertebrate fossil assemblage that documents a period of extreme climatic warmth without seasonal ice, with minimum mean annual temperatures of 14°C. The extreme warmth allowed species expansion and establishment of an ecosystem more easily able to support large birds, especially in fresh water bodies such as those present in the Turonian High Arctic. Review of the high latitude distribution of Northern Hemisphere Mesozoic birds shows only ornithurine birds are known to have occupied these regions. We propose physiological differences in ornithurines such as growth rate may explain their latitudinal distribution especially as temperatures decline later in the Cretaceous. Distribution and physiology merit consideration as factors in their preferential survival of parts of one ornithurine lineage, Aves, through the K/Pg boundary.  Digital files of an open access manuscript and supplemental materials file and digital copies of figures that went into the manuscript are included with this data set upload. Samples were collected during field seasons on Axel Heiberg Island. Cat scan imagery was conducted at the University of Texas, Austin.

In Greenland, the GNET project, or Greenland Network, was developed to establish a network of GPS receivers operating continuously and autonomously on stable bedrock around Greenland. The purpose of the January 26-27, 2017 workshop was to discuss the future of this network. We were especially focused on documenting how GNET is used now, how the network could evolve, and to ask what scientific questions motivate its future. GNET data have served many purposes, such as providing ground truth for predictive models for post glacial rise/fall of bedrock adjacent to the ice sheet that in turn, play an essential role in correcting satellite gravity and altimetry based estimates of ice mass balance on decadal time scales.  In addition to enumerating past successes of GNET, we examined the value that the network may provide for new science, such as tropospheric and ionospheric mapping, gaining new insights concerning surface mass balance, ice dynamics and ocean tidal mapping among others. This workshop report is designed to capture some of these new explorations. There is an emphasis placed upon the components of ice sheet surface mass balance in this report. This is motivated by three recent science breakthroughs: Since about 2006, the negative mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet is dominated by melt processes Recent findings demonstrate that GNET have sensitivities to the loading components of the various elements of the surface mass balance The zenith-delays measured in the carrier phase of the electromagnetic pulses received at the stations are capable of significantly improving hindcast models of precipitation, fundamental to surface mass balance   The primary recommendations of this report are: Continue to support the continuous and autonomous operation of the current configuration of GNET. The spatial distribution and long time series of observations has enabled a wealth of scientific discovery, and extending these time series enables new science Maximize the utility of the current data by encouraging low-latency access to data Encouraging new uses of GNET data, such as tropospheric zenith delay analyses to improve atmospheric models in Greenland and use of these data for modeling the ionosphere If possible, densify the current network to better resolve those areas of maximum gradient in glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), and/or regions of rapid glacier change",2018-02-07T08:00:00Z,2020-05-21T20:42:43Z

Speleothems (stalagmites and stalactites) only are expected to grow in Arctic caves when the overlying permafrost has thawed and no longer presents an impermeable barrier to seepage from the surface into the cave. In this project, we reconstruct permafrost history in western Canada during Pleistocene interglacials from 131 uranium-thorium (U/Th) ages on 74 speleothems, providing a record of when speleothems grew in Arctic caves and, consequently, under what past climatic conditions permafrost thawed.  The project uses existing speleothem collections from three areas in western Canada spanning 17° of latitude and isolated to continuous permafrost zones. The U/Th dates document the extent of speleothem growth, and thus permafrost thaw, across variable interglacial conditions of the past 500 thousand years (kyr). The data suggest that permafrost in the Yukon region was largely stable over the last 500 kyr, with only limited thaw during the  Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 interglacial. Thawing is more common at the sites in central and southwestern Canada, but the MIS11 interglacial still stands out as the interglacial with the most permafrost melting during the last 500 kyr.",2020-01-01T08:00:00Z,2020-05-19T23:35:18Z

This workshop also presented integrated tools for helping scientists, funded by the NSF and working in the Arctic, better connect with rural communities. There is clearly a need to provide training as demonstrated by the 43 applications received for 8 spots. The workshop was led by a high-profile panel that included: Lisa Busch (Executive Director of the SSSC); Elizabeth Arnold, (a  science communication expert, University of Alaska journalism professor and former National Public Radio Senior correspondent); Angela Gonzalez (from the Rural Alaska Community Action Program, Inc., an Alaska Native with expertise in rural living); Richard Nelson (a cultural anthropologist and radio producer); Jackie Grebmeier and Lee Cooper, (University of Maryland research scientists with 40 years of experience working in the Arctic). The workshop was held in the Fall of 2016 at the SSSC which has a legacy of scientific training in Alaska and professional, nationally-recognized expertise in science communication. The Sitka workshop setting benefitted from the proximity of Mt. Edgecumbe High School, a state-operated boarding school, which has historically provided secondary education to students from over 90 Alaska Native villages across Alaska. The workshop prepared scientists to use rural community resources to hire a local resident to work on their scientific project. Over the course of three days, scientists received lectures and hands on practice activities and visited a variety of community locations typical of rural Alaska, including the tribal government offices, the public radio station, and a community center where they dined with local residents and talked about their research in a casual setting. Participants also learned some best practices for visiting school classrooms and they observed a Scientists in the Schools lesson within the Sitka Native Education Program. Workshop participants prepared a five-minute talk, without a PowerPoint, and presented it to Mt. Edgecumbe High School students who had pre-lessons in science communication in advance of the workshop. Students then evaluated the participants by filling out feedback forms that tested what the students had learned from the talks. Scientists learned about understanding their audience, replacing technical language with common words, and storytelling. They received training in working with the media, and learned the importance and relevance of tribal governance to scientific work.

The hydraulic properties of glaciers are a major factor influencing the rate at which glaciers slide on the underlying rock. Understanding subglacial flow is critical to developing models that accurately predict how glaciers will behave in response to warming climate and how glaciers will contribute to sea level rise. For outreach and educational purposes, the project will develop a web-based, interactive fluid dynamics tutorial concerning subglacial conduits. A project web site will also be developed. The project will contribute to workforce development by supporting the training of a graduate student and by providing partial support for three early-career scientists. This study will perform three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) large eddy simulations (LES) of turbulent flows in a subglacial conduit using realistic surfaces and mesh boundaries. The computations will be done using 3D high-performance computing. The conduit geometry and roughness will be based on a unique set of field measurements made on a Svalbard glacier using with a modified video-game controller at mm resolution. The result of this effort is a first-ever high resolution visualization of a real subglacial conduit and the first subglacial LES simulations with realistic geometry. Results will be compared with model output using the more standard Darcy-Weisbach or Manning formulations. The study will provide improved insights into hydrological processes in mountain glaciers and large ice sheets such as the Greenland Ice Sheet.

The main goal is to provide tools that will enable a better access to polar data and information, hence allowing to spend more time on analysis and research, and significantly less time on discovery and searching. A large-scale web crawler, PolarHub, is developed to continuously mine the Internet to discover dispersed polar data. Beside identifying polar data in major data repositories, PolarHub is also able to bring individual hidden resources forward, hence increasing the discoverability of polar data. Quality and assessment of data resources are analyzed inside of PolarHub, providing a key tool for not only identifying issues but also to connect the research community with optimal data resources.

In the current PolarHub system, seven different types of geospatial data and processing services that are compliant with OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) are supported in the system. They are:
-- OGC Web Map Service (WMS): is a standard protocol for serving (over the Internet)georeferenced map images which a map server generates using data from a GIS database.
-- OGC Web Feature Service (WFS): provides an interface allowing requests for geographical features across the web using platform-independent calls.
-- OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS): Interface Standard defines Web-based retrieval of coverages; that is, digital geospatial information representing space/time-varying phenomena.
-- OGC Web Map Tile Service (WMTS): is a standard protocol for serving pre-rendered georeferenced map tiles over the Internet.
-- OGC Sensor Observation Service (SOS): is a web service to query real-time sensor data and sensor data time series and is part of theSensor Web. The offered sensor data comprises descriptions of sensors themselves, which are encoded in the Sensor Model Language (SensorML), and the measured values in the Observations and Measurements (O and M) encoding format.
-- OGC Web Processing Service (WPS): Interface Standard provides rules for standardizing how inputs and outputs (requests and responses) for invoking geospatial processing services, such as polygon overlay, as a web service.
-- OGC Catalog Service for the Web (CSW): is a standard for exposing a catalogue of geospatial records in XML on the Internet (over HTTP). The catalogue is made up of records that describe geospatial data (e.g. KML), geospatial services (e.g. WMS), and related resources.

Translation and dissemination of 55 Inuit interviews, a field expedition to collect additional interviews and test variables of tusk sensitivity, the creation of anatomic plates utilizing Inuit observation, and broad based initiatives in
social and natural sciences, are proposed in this study to help understand one of science's most intriguing organ systems. Preliminary findings from Inuit interview recordings, and scientific laboratory and field studies, describe the narwhal tusk as a sophisticated sensor that can discern changing salinity concentrations, and potentially other variables of pressure, temperature, and osmotic gradients. Because of the sensitivity to salinity concentrations in sea water, the erupted male tusk may have the ability to read and navigate ice formation in arctic waters. The whale's migration and behavior patterns may thus be potential indicators of arctic climate and environmental change. The broader impact for this study extends to three major groups of people that include Inuit communities in Nunavut and northwestern Greenland, students and faculty in university-based programs of social and natural sciences, and collaborating scientists. As one of eight IPY endorsed projects that addresses social and natural science, this study will engage the Inuit people on multiple levels by 1) employing an Inuit student researcher, 2) continuing interviews of elders and hunters in communities associated with the narwhal, 3) requesting experienced hunters to oversee anatomic plate renditions of narwhal phenotypes, 4) utilizing Inuit experience as guides on expedition, 5) enlisting Inuit artists for visualization of IQ observations and 6) organizing a discussion-based workshop on IQ uses in science attended by elders and scientists from America. In the broader context of IPY, this study will leave a legacy of a nexus of scientists, young investigators, and indigenous peoples interested
in understanding how this unusual animal fits into the puzzle of its arctic environment, and a template for future investigations that bridge Inuit experiences and Western scientific thought. Telling the story, is a tapestry woven with Inuit hands, as the essential fibers of experience and observation of narwhal anatomy, migration, population, distribution and behavior create patterns within the interviews recorded. Insights, perceptions, and observations from Inuit elders and hunters have assisted, influenced, and led to several scientific findings. Their knowledge has already inspired a dialogue that extends from graduate student evolutionary biology programs, to grade school classrooms as a future generation contemplates the wonder
of this tusk, and the Inuit people who know it so intimately. Educational outreach for this work is tied to the broader impact as translations from Inuktitut and Greenlandic dialects will be organized in book format, Web based MP3 and MP4 sound files, archival digital sound wave files, and professional broadcast digital video. These recordings will be disseminated to recognized institutions and individuals based on ethical standards established. Who will
listen? Thus far, over 200 large media sources around the world have delivered the message in video, print, radio and Web-based programs that have excited millions of inquisitive minds. As in studies of dental anthropology, where important findings of social science, like diet, migration, distribution, habits and behavior, can be described, this work also offers important contributions for this species.

This heat enters the Arctic Ocean by direct solar heating and by the transport of heat with flows from the Atlantic Ocean and Bering Sea. The warm waters from the Atlantic Ocean are isolated from direct contact with the sea ice by subsurface colder waters. This project will develop a model that synthesizes our understanding of important physical processes in the Arctic Ocean, compare the model output to observations, use the model to increase understanding of the processes responsible for modulating heat flux to the sea ice, and understand the observed recent trends in those processes.  The principal investigator proposes to study processes that lead to water mass transformation within the Chukchi Sea, exchange across the shelfbreak to the basin interior, and the melting of ice using a very high resolution regional numerical model in conjunction with recent and historical observations. The model is a realistically configured coupled ocean/sea ice model forced by synoptic atmospheric fields and flow through Bering Strait. Physical processes responsible for exchange of mass, heat, freshwater, and tracers across the shelfbreak will be diagnosed. The circulation and fluxes in the model will be compared with in-situ mooring and hydrographic data. The objectives of the proposed study are to better understand the processes responsible for cross shelf exchange in the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean, their relation to ice melt in the interior, and how they might change in a changing Arctic climate. The focus of the regional model is to diagnose the mechanisms responsible for shelf-basin exchange and relate them to the basic forcing mechanisms in this region (flow through Bering Strait and the atmosphere). The efficiency of the regional model allows for large numbers of calculations to be carried out, and for hypotheses relating to exchange to be tested. Such a process-based approach allows for a general understanding of the controlling physics with broader implications for other regions and forcing scenarios.",2017-10-19T07:00:00Z,2020-05-21T19:17:07Z

While the role of subglacial hydraulics during the surge has been well documented, the issue of surge initiation has remained unsolved. Also, the related question of why some glaciers surge and others do not remains open. This data set supported work to investigate whether the special geometry of many Alaska Range glaciers allows particularly large shear stresses to develop that eventually allow a surge to occur. The work focused on the Black Rapids Glacier on the Denali Fault in the eastern Alaska Range. This data set contains time lapse photos collected at three sites to document the filling and draining of ice-marginal lakes. These lakes drain annually to the glacier bed and lubricate it, leading to a glacier speed-up by a factor of two or three that can last more than a day. Such events act like mini-surges.

It is an update to the original Arctic Ocean Tidal Inverse Model (AOTIM5) model developed in 2004 ( Padman and Erofeeva, 2004 ). Arc5km2018 was created using the OSU Tidal Inversion Software (OTIS) package . The bathymetry grid is based on the original International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (IBCAO) bathymetry ( Jakobsson et al., 2000 ). Arc5km2018 was developed using the scheme described in Egbert and Erofeeva (2002) , and consists of grids of sea surface height and depth-integrated currents (""volume transports"") for each of 12 tidal constituents; 5 semidiurnal (M2, S2, K2, N2, 2N2), 4 diurnal (K1, O1, P1, Q1), and 3 non-linear (M4, MS4, MN4). Arc5km2018 assimilates coastal and benthic tide gauges, and TOPEX/Poseidon/Jason and European Space Agency (ESA) satellite radar altimetry, to improve the five largest-amplitude constituents, M2, S2, N2, K1 and O1.  Arc5km2018 includes the following updates relative to AOTIM5: (1) it uses an improved prior model with ocean open boundary forcing from an updated TOPEX/Poseidon global barotropic global tide solution (TPXO9.1); (2) it adds four tidal constituents, 2N2 and the three non-linear constituents; and (3) it assimilates much longer time series of altimetry, notably from the ESA satellites that sample to 81.5 degrees north.  We recommend that users compare results from Arc5km2018 and AOTIM5, which is also available at the Arctic Data Center , before deciding which to use for a specific application.

Dataset Description:

This dataset is a collection of web crawls from three primary sources:

Dr. Chris Mattmann's crawl of ADE, performed at the Open Science Codefest and at the [NSF DataViz Hackathon for Polar CyberInfrastructure] (http://nsf-polar-cyberinfrastructure.github.io/datavis-hackathon/)
Dr. Mattmann's student Angela Wang, contributed 3 datasets: 2 crawls of ACADIS and one of NASA AMD.
Dr. Mattmann's CSCI 572 Course at USC, students submitted 13 individual crawls of NASA ACADIS, NSIDC ADE, and AMD.
Each web crawl used Apache Nutch as the core framework for web crawling and Apache Tika as the main content detection and extraction framework. Nutch is a distributed search engine that runs on top of Apache Hadoop. Apache Tika is an open source framework for metadata exploration, automatic text mining, and information retrieval.

Web crawls were focused on three polar data repositories: the National Science Foundation Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information System (ACADIS), the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) Arctic Data Explorer (ADE), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Antarctic Master Directory (AMD).

The finished Polar dataset is composed of 17 distinct web crawls, containing 1,741,530 records (158 GB) across the three Polar science data repositories, which themselves are largely uncoordinated.",2017-07-27T07:00:00Z,2020-05-20T16:52:56Z

The overarching workshop themes were to: 1) Provide a venue where alternative viewpoints and traditional and disciplinary understanding may be voiced to enhance our knowledge of change in the New Arctic; 2) Explore alternative scenarios resulting from the loss of Arctic resilience that have occurred or are underway, sources of adaptive capacity and pathways for transformation to desired states, and methods to enhance the resilience of desirable states; 3) Develop a framework for assessing risk profiles associated with alternative scenarios for Indigenous Peoples’ and non-Indigenous communities; and 4) Communicate our results with Indigenous and other local stakeholders in the Arctic, and, with local funding, in the mid-latitudes.  Our workshops attempted a convergence of expertise within a complex adaptive systems model of the New Arctic. This framework integrates components from Indigenous Peoples’ traditional knowledge, ecology, sociology, psychology, climate sciences, geosciences, computer science, economics, and human health. Importantly, as the Arctic continues to rapidly transform, there is a genuine risk of growing inequity. Indigenous Peoples’ narratives surrounding social, cultural, and economic mechanisms to prevent such inequity are often underrepresented. Our workshops directly addressed this by including listening sessions with Indigenous and other local stakeholders at the outset of the workshop series, with stakeholders invited to attend part or all of the rest of the workshop presentations and discussions.  We successfully held four workshops focused on our initial themes and goals.  Two of these workshops were held in Alaska (Fairbanks and Anchorage), specifically integrating Arctic perspectives.  A third was held in Lincoln, Nebraska, and focused on Arctic-mid-latitude connections, and included local Indigenous groups and agricultural producers.  A fourth, smaller, workshop was held outside of San Francisco, and focused on integration and manuscript writing.  The Alaska workshops included listening sessions from Indigenous representatives and opportunities for all participants to express their knowledge and opinions regarding the rapidly changing Arctic.  Participants in the workshops presented to the group their own expertise and tools of their trade, framed around the workshop themes to encourage cohesion and stimulate convergence; heard stories of change in the Arctic from Indigenous peoples; participated in roundtable, open forum discussions; broadly sketched out alternative futures to explore various, unscripted paths; and explored aspects of the New Arctic, what convergence means, goals and endpoints of the workshops and novel tools for assessing change.  We closed out the convergence process with a fourth workshop to discuss and synthesize both the successes and failures of our Arctic convergence process, as well as a broader discussion about the critical elements necessary for a convergence process, and the challenges and barriers to success.  These workshops opened new pathways of discussion, communication and collaboration amongst a very diverse group of participants.  Participants reported that the networking and collaborative aspects of the workshops were most useful.  Participants included a large number of early career scientists and managers who were able to jumpstart collaborative relationships with more senior personnel, and with indigenous peoples in the Arctic and in Nebraska.",2020-01-01T08:00:00Z,2020-05-19T20:35:07Z

All observations will be published in special issue with other collaborators on the project (citation available after publication), or can be obtained from the author at macinnes@geology.cwu.edu
This dataset was collected as part of an interdisciplinary human/ecosystems resilience project in the Islands of the Four Mountains that included the study of hazards caused by earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. The Four Mountains island group provide an excellent opportunity to assess the development of prehistoric human adaptations to geological hazards and environmental change because they lie within a zone of high catastrophic potential. As examples, Mt. Cleveland, has erupted explosively more than 20 times in the last decade and during the time of prehistoric human habitation. The Aleutian plate boundary is the site of four earthquakes having a magnitude greater than 8 and dozens with magnitudes greater than 7, and these have generated tsunamis historically and prehistorically. 
The Four Mountain prehistoric sites are little studied but are highly significant for interpreting the role of geologic hazards on human migration and societal development in the Aleutian archipelago. The 2-year project (2014-2015) included a team of professional and student archaeologists, geologists, ecologists, and zoologists. Extensive datasets, in addition to the tsunami dataset here, include radiocarbon, geological, paleoenvironmental, and cultural data. These data yield novel insights into the record of geological hazards, human coping mechanisms, changing subsistence, and adaptations during the prehistoric and European contact periods. Additionally, assessing the degree to which geological hazards in the Aleutian archipelago disrupted prehistoric human and ecological systems has important lessons for current inhabitants of the northern Pacific Rim.",2017-04-28T07:00:00Z,2020-05-19T20:41:52Z

doi:10.18739/A29S1KK8S,Michael Bergin,"Daily Averages of Aerosol Properties in Summit, Greenland",aerosol albedo Greenland snow,"The collaborative team will take advantage of the currently funded Greenland Inland Traverse (GrIT) traveling between Thule and Summit Greenland to access a spatially diverse area of the GIS in order to better understand albedo variability and the snow properties that influence albedo. The GrIT route offers a unique opportunity to study a wide range of snow accumulation zones (i.e. the ablation zone, soaked snow zone, the percolation zone and the dry snow zone) across Greenland, which are expected to have a broad range of albedo values as well as significant variability in snow physical properties and concentrations of light absorbing compounds (i.e. dust, elemental carbon, and brown carbon). The project's field component will take place over two seasons during the spring of 2013 and 2014. The approach will include stopping along the traverse to collect coincident daily measurements of snow spectral albedo, snow physical properties (i.e. specific surface area, density), surface snow light absorption properties (i.e. wavelength dependent absorption of water soluble compounds and particulates), and the concentrations of trace elements, organic, and elemental carbon. Additionally, the temporal evolution of spectral albedo will be monitored continuously during the sunlit months using autonomous stations deployed along the traverse route to track seasonal variations of snow albedo and to help attribute these variations to the physical and chemical composition of the snow. The results of this project will yield a unique data set characterizing the temporal and spatial variability of surface albedo as well as the physical and chemical properties of Greenland snow, which are broadly useful to both modeling, ice mass balance, and remote sensing communities. Conference presentations, rapid publication of results, and most importantly close collaboration with modelers, (i.e. through work with the CESM PCWG) will ensure that this knowledge is used to improve process parameterizations in predictive global climate models. The team will also build on international collaborations begun in the Dartmouth IGERT program, including a week-long ambassadorship to Nuuk by co-PI Polashenski including lectures at the college and Katuuaq cultural center. Graduate, undergraduate, and high school student training will also be included in the project.",2012-10-26T07:00:00Z,2020-05-21T17:22:53Z

LOWE FOR MORE INFORMATION.  A cross-section of youth and young adults across the Bering Sea region were interviewed on their post-secondary educational opportunities facilitated by the Community Development Quota (CDQ) program. The overarching project research question was: Do opportunities in post-secondary education for youth contribute to the viability of Bering Sea communities and way of life? ""Viability""is defined by the degree to which a community can balance in- and out-migration, sustain a context of livelihood diversification, and create bridges to resources external to the community. To answer the research question, the investigators therefore also asked: Are there differences between contributions of college degree earners and those of vocational training graduates?  What is the effect of post-secondary education on rural community out-migration for youth in Alaska? What is the effect of post-secondary education on occupation selection among rural Alaska youth?  What kinds of educational opportunities contribute to bridging youth with resources external to coastal communities?  Are there academic, sociocultural, or economic constraints preventing students from completing their studies or training? Hypotheses tested included the following: 1) More educational scholarships are awarded than vocational training grants. 2) More women are applying for post-secondary awards. 3) Completion of post-secondary education is correlated with outmigration. 4) Participation in educational ""bridging"" programs contribute to completion of education or training.  5) The majority of respondents who did not complete their studies dropped out after one year.  6) The average time to completion of studies is much longer than the traditional four years.  7) Having a social support network contributes to completion of studies. 8) Lack of adequate academic preparation contributes to non-completion of studies. 9) Financial hardship/poverty contributes to non-completion of studies. 10) Most people leave Western Alaska to find employment.
Data sets included: 1) Western Alaska regional profile summaries of U.S. Census and State of Alaska data on: demographics, employment, development, subsistence economy data, educational statistics, and subsistence harvest data. 2) Ethnographic fieldnotes; 3) Focus group interview transcripts from 31 students interviewed at the University of Alaska and Alaska Career Academy; 5) An SPSS data file of 351 survey responses for survey on Alaska rural youth scholarship outcomes.",2017-09-12T07:00:00Z,2020-05-21T17:48:35Z

These measurements will be used to improve estimates of rates and patterns of and controls on annual GHG fluxes, with special contribution to understanding of the fall, winter and spring fluxes. This project will be among the first efforts toward the estimation of a full annual budget of both CH 4 and CO 2 net emissions from three tundra ecosystems across a transect in Arctic Alaska. Of primary importance is the quantification of non-summertime CH 4 emissions because of the potentially large impact on overall climatic effects. This information has historically been very difficult to collect because of severe weather and remote monitoring stations. Recent advances in measurement technology will make these studies feasible in remote locations and under extreme weather conditions. In particular, this research will make use of the new closed-path LI-7200 and the self-cleaning and heated, low-power,open-path LI-7700 CH 4 analyzer for the most remote site (Ivotuk). The team will employ the closed-path CH 4 Los Gatos analyzer that corrects for the cross-sensitivity of water for the Barrow and Atqasuk sites. A heated sonic Class-A METEK will be used to record turbulence measurements. In-situ measurements of oxidation-reduction potential, pH, dissolved gases, chemical characterization of soils and soil pore water, and metagenomic analysis will elucidate the dominant respiratory pathways.

Scattered observations indicate that beavers (Castor canadensis) have moved from the forest into tundra areas during the last 20 years, likely in response to broader physical and ecosystem changes occurring in Arctic and Boreal regions. The implications of beaver inhabitation in the Arctic and Boreal are unique relative to other ecosystems due to the presence of permafrost and its vulnerability associated with beaver dams and inundation. Our study specifically examines the role of beavers in controlling surface water dynamics and related thermokarst development in low Arctic tundra regions. We mapped the number of beaver dams visible in sub-meter resolution satellite images acquired between 2002 and 2019 for a 100 square kilometer study area (12 years of imagery) near Kotzebue, Alaska and a 430 square kilometer study area (3 years of imagery) encompassing the entire northern Baldwin Peninsula, Alaska. We show that during the last two decades beaver-driven ecosystem engineering is responsible for the majority of surface water area changes and inferred thermokarst development in the study area. This has implications for interpreting surface water area changes and thermokarst dynamics in other Arctic and Boreal regions that may also result from beaver dam building activities.

During the course of the project, we published nine journal papers, and one still under review. Our main outcomes are: 1) built up the coupled ice-ocean mBGC codes into the RASM; 2) evaluated the model extensively in the subarctic and Arctic Oceans with multidecadal observational data. The global coarse resolution model and high resolution regional model converge to similar mean status of observed physical ecosystem environments in general, but high resolution model can better represent areas with sharp topographic gradient, and shelf-basin exchanges, thus get reduced model errors compared with observations; 3) compared with other arctic ecosystem models with different model domains, resolutions and parameters to better understand model behaviors. Our models performed reasonably well in simulation of spatial distribution of annual cycle of ocean stratification, nutrients, chlorophyll and primary production etc. compared to other models; 4) investigate arctic marine ecosystem changes in response to climate changes. Under a warming arctic with declining sea ice cover, the total primary production within the Arctic Circle is increasing according to our model, in agreement with several other models and remote sensing results. 5) released the RASM version 1 to general public and conducted education and outreach through various presentations at scientific conferences and to non-professional audiences.

AOTIM5 was created using the OSU Tidal Inversion Software (OTIS) package (https://www.tpxo.net/). Model development is described by Padman and Erofeeva (2004) (https://doi.org/10.1029/2003GL019003). The bathymetry grid is based on the original International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (IBCAO) bathymetry (Jakobsson et al., 2000; https://doi.org/10.1029/00EO00059). AOTIM5 consists of grids of sea surface height and depth-integrated currents (“volume transports”) for each of 8 tidal constituents; 4 semidiurnal (M2, S2, K2, N2) and 4 diurnal (K1, O1, P1, Q1). The first step in building AOTIM5 was development of the Arctic Ocean Dynamics-based Tide Model (AODTM5), which is also available at the Arctic Data Center (https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi:10.18739/A2901ZG3N). That model was forced at open ocean boundaries by the TOPEX/Poseidon global barotropic tidal solution version 6.2 (TPXO.6.2), and by local astronomical forcing (“potential tides”). Each constituent in AODTM5 was tuned, separately, to Arctic tide height data by optimizing the linear drag coefficient. AOTIM5 used AODTM5 as a “prior” model, then assimilated coastal and benthic tide gauges, and TOPEX/Poseidon and ERS satellite radar altimetry, to improve the 4 largest-amplitude constituents, M2, S2, K1 and O1.  An updated version of this model created in 2018, Arc5km2018, is also available at the Arctic Data Center. The newer model uses updated open boundary conditions, and a wider range of assimilated data including much longer satellite altimetry records. We recommend that users compare results from AOTIM5 and Arc5km2018 before deciding which to use for a specific application.

Warming of the Arctic may lead to the release of stored methane, leading to further warming and then to further methane releases in a reinforcing cycle. The East Siberian Sea, in the Arctic Ocean, is a large area with a great deal of undersea permafrost and, likely, stored methane. Recent work has suggested large sources of methane from parts of the East Siberian Sea, but the area needs to be mapped and studied in much greater detail before either the amount of methane stored there or the amount being released can be fully understood. In the summer of 2014, an international program called the Swedish-Russian-US Arctic Ocean Investigation of Climate-Cryosphere-Carbon Interactions (SWERUS-C3) will undertake a 90-day expedition to map, and study the carbon cycle in, the East Siberian Sea. The principal investigators of this proposal are leaders in ocean mapping and they have recently pioneered techniques for acoustic imaging of methane plumes released from the seafloor in the Gulf of Mexico. They have been invited by the leaders of the SWERUS-C3 team to participate in one leg of the expedition. They propose to use the multibeam sonar on board the ODEN to locate and characterize gas seeps in the water column and then apply a newly developed wideband transceiver to the split-beam echosounder on board the ODEN to constrain the size and fate of gas bubbles rising to the surface. Together, these acoustic observations will help the SWERUS-C3 team understand the flux of methane from the seafloor into the water column and potentially into the atmosphere. If successful, these techniques will allow the mapping of the gas flux in the Arctic over scales never before possible. This proposal requests support for the participation of the UNH team on this expedition and for post-cruise work-up of the data. The project will support a full time graduate student at UNH. A UNH undergraduate student will participate as well. The SWERUS-C3 program as a whole will support over 15 postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, and has a broad suite of outreach activities planned. The UNH Center for Coastal Ocean Mapping will also incorporate this work into ongoing outreach and education activities.

doi:10.18739/A2901ZG3N,Laurie Padman,"AODTM5: Arctic Ocean Dynamics-based Tide Model, on 5 kilometer grid, developed in 2004",Tide Model Arctic Ocean currents sea surface height,"The 5 kilometer (km) Arctic Ocean Dynamics-based Tide Model published in 2004 (AODTM5) is a barotropic tide model on a polar stereographic grid. Model development is described by Padman and Erofeeva (2004) (https://doi.org/10.1029/2003GL019003). The bathymetry grid is based on the original International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (IBCAO) bathymetry (Jakobsson et al., 2000; https://doi.org/10.1029/00EO00059). AODTM5 consists of grids of sea surface height (SSH) and depth-integrated currents (“volume transports”) for each of 8 tidal constituents; 4 semidiurnal (M2, S2, K2, N2) and 4 diurnal (K1, O1, P1, Q1). The model solves the depth-integrated shallow water equations, with forcing at open ocean boundaries from the TOPEX/Poseidon global barotropic tidal solution version 6.2 (TPXO.6.2) and local astronomical forcing (“potential tides”). Each constituent in AODTM5 was tuned, separately, to Arctic tide height data by optimizing the linear drag coefficient.  As a dynamics-based model, AODTM5 is self-consistent: within the constraints of the simplified physics, heights and currents are determined by the bathymetric grid and the imposed forcing. Two other tide models are available at the Arctic Data Center; the Arctic Ocean Inverse Tide Model on a 5 km grid (AOTIM5) (also described by Padman and Erofeeva, 2004) and an updated version created in 2018 (Arc5km2018). These two models are “inverse” models, assimilating tide gauge, bottom pressure recorder and satellite altimetry estimates of SSH. We expect these data assimilation models to provide more accurate predictions of SSH. However, they do not necessarily provide better predictions of depth-averaged currents. We recommend that users compare results from all three models (AODTM5, AOTIM5 and Arc5km2018) before deciding which to use for a specific application.

Little is known about the fate of PBDEs in arctic surface waters, especially in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM).  DOM has been shown to interact with hydrophobic organic contaminants and can alter their mobility, bioavailability, and degradation.  In this dataset, the partitioning of six PBDE congeners between Arctic DOM and water was measured using the aqueous solubility enhancement (SE) method.  Measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC)-water equilibrium partition coefficients (KDOC) values were nearly an order of magnitude lower than previously reported values for the same PBDE congeners and are in units of L/kg of organic carbon.  Measured results compared favorably with values calculated using poly-parameter linear free energy models (pp-LFER) developed for other DOM.  Log KDOC values initially increased with increasing PBDE hydrophobicity but approached a threshold value of ~5, which is likely due to elevated steric hindrance of highly brominated congeners. This study is the first to comprehensively measure KDOC values for a range of PBDE congeners with DOM isolated from arctic surface waters.

Unfortunately, satellite observations of sea ice only extend back to 1979, and direct observations before then are spotty at best. Recently, there have been several advances in sea ice proxies. Specifically improvements in diatom-based proxies and the molecular biomarker, IP25, have allowed quantitative reconstructions of Arctic sea ice. Today, the Bering Sea is seasonally covered in sea ice, and diatoms dominate primary productivity there. This makes it an ideal location for a diatom-based sea ice proxy. This proxy is still in development and will be based on the data presented here compared to satellite-derived sea ice concentration averaged over the ten years preceding sampling. The data set archived here contains diatom counts and detailed grain size analysis for a suite of core tops spanning the range of annual sea ice concentration found in the Bering Sea. Samples were collected on board the Healy during May 2006 and June 2007 as well as from two USGS cruises in 1969.

Satellite data reveal that patterns in sea ice cover have been spatially heterogeneous, with significant declines in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, yet more complex multi-year variability in the Bering Sea south of St. Lawrence Island. These patterns in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas have intensified since 2000, indicating a regime shift in sea ice cover across the northern portion of the PAR. In particular, satellite data over 1979–2012 reveal localized decreases in sea ice presence of up to -1.64 days/year (Canada Basin) and -1.24 days/year (Beaufort Sea), which accelerated to up to -6.57 days/year (Canada Basin) and -12.84 days/year (Beaufort Sea) over the 2000–2012 time period. In contrast, sea ice in the Bering Sea shows more complex multi-year variability with localized increases in sea ice presence of up to +8.41 days/year since 2000. The observed increases in sea ice cover since 2000 in the southern Bering Sea shelf region are observed in wintertime, whereas sea ice losses in the Canada Basin and Beaufort Sea have occurred during summer. In this study, we summarize the recent variability in sea ice cover across the broader PAR, including the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas. We pay particular attention to sea ice using relatively high spatial resolution (6.25 km) sea ice concentrations derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) sensor on the Aqua satellite platform . Based on a 15% sea ice concentration threshold to categorize sea ice as being either present or absent, annual sea ice persistence, the timing of sea ice breakup, and the timing of sea ice formation are quantified with AMSR-E data spanning 2003–2011 (up until the point of instrument failure in October 2011).",2016-03-04T08:00:00Z,2020-05-15T21:21:58Z

doi:10.18739/A2ZG6G73B,Monica Arienzo,Continuous Plutonium measurements from an array of Arctic and Antarctic ice cores,ANS,"Atmospheric nuclear weapons testing (NWT) resulted in the injection of plutonium (Pu) into the atmosphere and subsequent global deposition. We present a new method for continuous semi-quantitative measurement of 239Pu in ice cores, which was used to develop annual records of fallout from NWT in ten ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica. The 239Pu was measured directly using an Inductively Coupled Plasma - Sector Field Mass Spectrometer, thereby reducing analysis time and increasing depth-resolution with respect to previous methods. To validate this method, we compared our one year averaged results to published 239Pu records and other records of NWT. The 239Pu profiles from four Arctic ice cores reflected global trends in NWT and were in agreement with discrete Pu profiles from lower latitude ice cores. The 239Pu measurements in the Antarctic ice cores tracked low latitude NWT, consistent with previously published discrete records from Antarctica. Advantages of the continuous 239Pu measurement method are (1) reduced sample preparation and analysis time; (2) no requirement for additional ice samples for NWT fallout determinations; (3) measurements are exactly co-registered with all other chemical, elemental, isotopic, and gas measurements from the continuous analytical system; and (4) the long half-life means the 239Pu record is stable through time.",2016-06-10T07:00:00Z,2020-05-15T21:22:24Z

In spite of severe erosion problems, the Myvatn economy has been largely sustainable since the time when Iceland was first settled in the late ninth century. Until the
                early part of the twentieth century, the inhabitants of the region lived almost entirely on the proceeds of the land by farming, fishing for trout, and collecting the eggs of wild birds. In recent times, tourism has become an extremely important part
                of the economy. This brings needed revenue but raises conservation issues in what is a very fragile ecosystem. The interplay between the hydrology and geology of the area has formed a unique landscape characterised by an abundance of pseudo-craters
                and curious lava formations and an ecosystem that is unparalleled in Iceland. In the Myvatn area most resources are directly connected to water. The complex food web and biogeochemistry of the lake has created unique wildlife resources on which
                people depended, and adjacent wetlands produced the most important sources of hay for the animal husbandry practiced in the area. In the past, because of its North Atlantic location, marginal for agriculture, grass was the only viable crop in
                Iceland, and the economy focused primarily on the keeping of sheep and cattle until comparatively recent times. This meant that the success or failure of the grass crop, coupled with winter rangeland grazing, was the one aspect of the economy on
                which all else rested. If there was not enough hay to feed the livestock over the winter, then they could die, and the human population could also suffer with famines and related difficulties. The primary goal of this project was to establish what
                were the varying factors that influenced the success or failure of the grass growth and hay crop and grazing, and the sustainability of the use of these resources. A particularly important part of the project was to examine resource-management
                decisions and to consider to what extent local farmers focused on the long-term sustainability of grazing resources.",2017-02-16T08:00:00Z,2020-05-18T17:35:33Z

One core, DBSB, was dated using 210-Pb and 137-Cs. It was found to reach back to 1949 at 13 cm depth. Forty-six diatom taxa are recorded and diatom counts are presented either as raw counts or as relative percent abundances. Grain size is calculated using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer and is reported as weight percent for grain size bins ranging from 0.01 to 3700 Î¼m.

Data were collected with an automatic weather station using instrumentation from Campbell Scientific.  Large-scale atmospheric circulation systems affect the geographic distribution of precipitation in western North America, yet little is known about how these systems may have varied before the instrumental period of the last 150 years. The main goal of this project is to reconstruct the history of precipitation in Alaska during the last thousand years using ice core records of snow accumulation. The researchers plan to collect several new ice cores from the Mt. Hunter Plateau in the Alaska Range of Denali National Park and the new ice cores will be combined with an existing spatial array of ice cores in the region to map changes in the spatial patterns of precipitation. Because changes in atmospheric circulation patterns caused by ENSO and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) affect where the precipitation falls, this spatial array of ice cores will provide a record of how these larger scale climate systems have varied during the last thousand years. The project will focus on determining the differences in the precipitation patterns at the Little Ice Age (approximately 200 to 600 years ago) and Medieval Climate Anomaly (approximately 800 to 1,200 years ago).",2016-09-01T07:00:00Z,2020-05-18T17:58:01Z

This dataset contains data collected mostly around outlet glaciers in Greenland, including a large grid at Jakobshavn, with the specific purpose of improving understanding in this dynamic and fast changing part of the ice sheet. This product uses focused synthetic aperture array (SAR) processing to improve resolution in along-track. The array processing technique used to combine the multiple channels is based on the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm. The data product format is a Mathworks MATLAB file.  Files are named according to the format: Data{$image_id}_{$frame_id}.mat. The {$image_id} is a string which may be empty when it is a composite image or is of the form “img_II” where II is the 2-digit zero-padded image number always starting with 1 and incrementing from there. The frame ID is a concatenation of the segment ID and a frame number and follows the format YYYYMMDD_SS_FFF where FFF is the frame number from 000 to 999. For example, “Data_img_01_20080630_02_001.mat” contains data for image 01 from segment 02, frame 001, taken on 2008-06-30.

Thus, understanding the processes which drive melting of the calving fronts of tidewater glaciers by the ocean is fundamental to projections of future global mean sea level rise. Our understanding is however currently limited, partly due to the scarcity of oceanographic data from close to the calving fronts of tidewater glaciers.  The primary goal of these measurements was to quantify the ocean conditions adjacent to a west Greenland tidewater glacier. In particular, knowledge of the water temperature and water velocity is highly valuable as these are understood to be the two primary variables determining the rate at which the ocean melts the calving front of the glacier.  These data are 91 conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) casts collected near a tidewater glacier in Sarqardleq Fjord, West Greenland.  The data were collected during July 2013 and are averaged into 1-m bins.",2019-01-01T08:00:00Z,2019-01-15T21:30:35Z

This aquifer is created through percolation of surface meltwater downward through the firn, saturating the pore space above the ice-firn transition. The aquifer may play a significant role in sea level rise through storage or draining freshwater into the ocean, and the goal of our experiment was to quantify the volume of water that is stored in the aquifer system. The Greenland Ice Seismic Experiment (GreenISE) is to investigate the structure of this perennial firn aquifer found near the surface of the Greenland ice sheet. The experiment uses high frequency active source refraction seismology to probe the hydrology and structure of the uppermost firn and ice layers of the ice sheet. Locations were visited in two years to determine the variation in hydrologic setting over the Greenland summer and characterize the role of surface melting processes in ice sheets.

Jarvis Creek (634km2), which feeds the Delta and Tanana River in Interior Alaska, was studied as a proxy of the observed mountain glacier melting and permafrost degradation that has been documented across the Arctic region in recent decades.

Jarvis Creek (634km2), which feeds the Delta and Tanana River in Interior Alaska, was studied as a proxy of the observed mountain glacier melting and permafrost degradation that has been documented across the Arctic region in recent decades. The specific objectives were to 1) assess the hydrologic fluxes (including streamflow source components), stores, pathways and the role of glacier wastage on watershed hydrology, through hydrologic and geochemical field measurements as well as numerical and statistical modeling; 2) quantify the effect of glaciers and permafrost on recent historical (1960-present) hydrologic fluxes and storage by combining remote sensing, field measurements of glacier mass balance, and hydrology with a heat- and mass transfer model, and 3) project the future hydrologic regime using custom-derived downscaled climate projections. 
	The purpose of this dataset was to refine our understanding of the current and projected characteristics and controls of glacier mass balance, permafrost and water storage and fluxes. The dataset includes simulated results of glaciers, hydrology and soil temperatures at a 100m spatial and hourly (input) to monthly (output) temporal resolution. The simulated results are based upon hourly time series field measurements for forcing and model testing and existing geospatial datasets to inform the numerical glacier-permafrost-hydrology model. The hydrology model used was the Water balance Simulation Model (WaSiM) version 9.10.02c (www.wasim.ch).",2017-11-27T08:00:00Z,2017-11-27T00:00:00Z

Pollutant aerosols directly and indirectly perturb solar reflection and thermal radiative emission in the atmosphere, and soot accelerates melting when it accumulates on snow. Nonetheless, much remains unknown about how pollution plumes are modifying arctic cloud properties and precipitation. Consequently, the impact of pollution on the arctic climate system is not well understood.  Past research into aerosol-cloud interactions in the Arctic has generally focused on small time and spatial scales, using a combination of aircraft and numerical modeling work. Less research has investigated these processes over climatological time scales and pan-Arctic spatial scales.

The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) was established in the early 1990s to understand the effects of warming and environmental variability on tundra vegetation properties and ecosystem function. The ITEX program has been extremely valuable for detection of changes in tundra plant and ecosystem responses to experimental warming and to background climate change across sites that span the major ecosystems of the Arctic. In 2007, the Alaskan and Greenland ITEX sites were combined into an Arctic Observatory Network (AON). The current ITEX AON project will continue to document and understand Arctic terrestrial vegetation change and its ecosystem consequences by maintaining the long-term datasets of the ITEX-AON. The warming experiment of ITEX-AON allows us to assign the cause for observed changes in response to warming instead of relying on simple correlations. This project provides urgently needed data on changes in vegetation and the importance of these changes for ecosystem services from a variety of Arctic ecosystems. This project will provide training for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students in the emerging fields of remote sensing, cybertechnology and big-data analysis. The project will include outreach activities through strong relationships with the CLEO Institute in Miami; the Grand Valley State University Regional Math and Science Center; and K-12 school systems in Miami, Anchorage, Grand Rapids and El Paso. All data from this project are and will be freely available at the NSF (National Science Foundation) Arctic Data Center.  The core datasets of the proposed research include manual observations of phenology, vegetation structure and composition, and ecosystem function (carbon flux and nutrient cycling) on long-term ITEX control and experimental warming plots, repeat measurement of vegetation plots on the long-term 1 kilometer 2 vegetation grids, and a multifactor warming/moisture experiment in Greenland. In 2009, the sampling scheme was expanded to include a larger spatial component to amplify the value of the measurements collected. This expansion included the addition of phenocams, automated mobile sensor platforms, and medium-scale aerial imagery. The automated platforms measure a suite of vegetation surface properties with minimal effort across focal transects spanning strong moisture and microtopographic gradients at a near-daily frequency. These measurements capture the fine-scale changes in vegetation over the growing season that are missed by lower frequency manual measurements and provide a bridge between manual measurements and aerial imagery. Medium-scale aerial imagery, using Kite Aerial or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, is acquired throughout the growing season for scaling of manual and automated measurements; satellite imagery is referenced to medium-scale aerial imagery to aid scaling of responses to the regional level. In the newest phase of AON ITEX, we are particularly focused on understanding the relationship between landscape subsidence as a result of permafrost thaw and vegetation structure and function because of the potential for significant positive feedbacks to climate change.",2019-01-01T08:00:00Z,2020-06-02T23:04:57Z

If a uniform representation of the water table within each plot was visible, then a WTD tube was placed there to measure the change in water table throughout the season. For instance if the plot was half saturated and half dry, then that plot was skipped and no tube was placed there. The exact location of WTD tubes are as follows: Between meters 0-1, 2-3, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10, 11-12, 13-14, 15-16, 18-19, 20-21, 24-25, 26-27, 28-29, 30-31, 32-33, 34-35, 36-37, 38-39, 42-43, 44-45, 47-48, &amp;amp; 49-50. A total of 22 WTD tubes were installed into the MISP grid in both Barrow and Atqasuk. Measurements were made once a week during the summer snow free period between mid June and mid August. WTD was calculated as the difference between the depth (cm) of the water table above or below the measuring tube (- Values = water above tube, + Values= water level below the height of the tube) and the height of the top of the measuring tube above the ground level.

Global change models predict boreal forests will become increasingly susceptible to fire activity with climate warming. Because these forests contain a large proportion of global terrestrial carbon (C) stocks, changes in the fire regime are likely to alter global C cycling. Increased fire activity will increase C emissions to the atmosphere, with a potential positive feedback to climate warming. However, an altered fire regime may also initiate cascading effects on forest regrowth and permafrost degradation that could magnify or offset this feedback. Fire effects on these ecological mechanisms remain uncertain but will ultimately determine whether arctic ecosystems act as a C source or sink under future climate change scenarios. The primary objective of this research is to increase our understanding of post-fire C dynamics in boreal forests of the Siberian arctic by elucidating the ecological mechanisms by which increased fire severity could influence C accumulation and storage over the successional interval. The overarching hypothesis is that post-fire soil organic layer (SOL) depth regulates net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) through indirect impacts on forest regrowth and permafrost stability because of its role as a barrier to seed germination and thermal regulator. The team will: 1) link near term fire effects on SOL depth to changes in larch recruitment and permafrost characteristics in experimental burn plots created in 2012, 2) determine the relationship between post-fire stand structure and above- and belowground C pools at the local and landscape level across stands of varying age and topographic positions, and 3) test via experimental manipulations and field observations the mechanisms by which fire-driven changes in stand density indirectly affect moss growth, SOL development, and susceptibility of deeper C pools to warming, decomposition, and release into the atmosphere. This research will offer novel insights into the importance of both vegetation and soil processes within arctic ecosystems in determining the net feedback of an intensified fire regime to the climate system.  Intellectual Merit: Larch forests of the Siberian arctic comprise 20% of all boreal forest ecosystems and are distinct from other boreal forests in that they consist of a single tree genus (Larix spp.) with a deciduous growth habit and often grow on continuous, C-rich ?yedoma? permafrost. Thus, their response to warming climate and an altered fire regime is likely to differ from boreal forests in other regions. Uncertainties regarding current C pools in Siberian boreal forests remain a significant factor affecting our ability to predict climate-induced changes to the global C cycle. The proposed study will contribute to our understanding of how arctic forest fires impact global C cycling and provide essential data necessary for scaling-up arctic C pools, estimating C emissions from arctic fires, and calibrating predictive models of future global C cycling.  Broader Impacts: This project will result in the training of undergraduate and graduate students from two predominantly undergraduate institutions and one Hispanic-Serving Institution. The PI and her students will develop outreach activities with local K-12 schools in south Texas to help teachers create lesson plans involving arctic science, boreal ecology, and climate change and involve researcher presentations to science classrooms to provide real-life examples of arctic research and expose K-12 students to different career and educational paths in the sciences.",2018-05-17T07:00:00Z,2018-05-22T21:27:36Z

Since 1972, NIC has produced Arctic and Antarctic sea ice charts. This data set is an Arctic sea ice concentration climatology derived from the NIC weekly or biweekly operational ice chart time series. The charts used in the climatology are from 1972 through 2004, and the monthly climatology products are median, maximum, minimum, first quartile, and third quartile concentrations, as well as frequency of occurrence of ice at any concentration for 33 year, 10 year, and 5 year periods. These climatologies and the charts from which they are derived are provided in 25 km EASE-Grid (Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid/gridded binary). Ice extent can be derived from concentration by summing the number of equal area EASE-Grid cells. GIF browse files are also provided. The climatologies are also made available in a Geographical Information System (GIS) compatible format. NIC charts are produced through the analyses of available in situ, remote sensing, and model data sources. They are generated primarily for mission planning and safety of navigation. NIC charts generally show more ice than do passive microwave derived sea ice concentrations, particularly in the summer when passive microwave algorithms tend to underestimate ice concentration. The record of sea ice concentration from the NIC series is believed to be more accurate than that from passive microwave sensors, especially from the mid-1990s on (see references in the documentation), but it lacks the consistency of some passive microwave time series.",2009-11-18T08:00:00Z,2016-09-16T00:50:42Z

A better understanding of the coupled biological-physical ocean ecosystem, and its interannual variability, is necessary to predict and understand these potential impacts of climate change on the Arctic ecosystem. The Chukchi-Beaufort Sea region near Barrow, AK, including coastal waters, has been identified as key because it lies at the junction of several ocean regions and downstream of the Pacific Arctic gateway and hence is influenced physically and ecologically by input from Bering Strait. Researchers have conducted oceanographic sampling of the coupled physical and biological marine environment in the Chukchi and near-shore Beaufort Seas for five years (2005 to 2009), including coastal waters, using boat-based surveys during late summer and short-term (month) and year-long bottom-mounted moorings, and have observed significant interannual variability. They will now establish annual surveys of the pelagic marine environment and deploy a year-round mooring in Barrow Canyon as components of the Arctic Observing Network (AON). The surveys will measure a range of biological and physical parameters including hydrography, currents, plankton standing stocks, nutrients, and plankton genetics. The mooring will measure ocean currents, near bottom temperature and salinity, and acoustic backscatter (zooplankton proxy) in Barrow Canyon at a location typically within or beneath the Alaska Coastal Current.   Results from this AON component will provide a 10-year record and enable a better understanding of inter-annual variability in the physical and biological characteristics of the Barrow area ocean confluence. Based on these data, changes in biological characteristics that respond to larger climate change can be detected. This proposed AON component includes measurements of key oceanic biological and chemical parameters, and their coupling to physical parameters from a region sensitive to climate change.   The researchers will actively communicate plans and results with the community of Barrow through formal and informal discussions and presentations. They will also support the participation of a teacher in fieldwork for two of the years.",NA,2016-11-18T20:01:24Z

By advancing the development of a spatial-temporal network of ice core accumulation records covering the past millennium in the NE Pacific region of the United States, this research will foster a greater understanding of regional hydrologic response to the coupled ENSO system.  The researchers propose to investigate the hypothesis that a change occurred from a persistent La Nina-like state during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) to a persistent El Nino-like state during the Little Ice Age (LIA). The research team will test this hypothesis by reconstructing and evaluating the spatial precipitation anomaly pattern in the Northeast Pacific across the MCA-LIA transition. Their hypothesis is founded on modern observations that show an enhanced (weaker) coastal-inland precipitation gradient in the region during La Nina (El Nino) conditions. The researchers predict that the NE Pacific precipitation anomaly pattern will weaken across the MCA-LIA transition.  The project will support an early career scientist, provide support for undergraduate and graduate students, and enable outreach to K-12 teachers and students through the PolarTREC program, an NSF funded program which seeks to link K-12 teachers with Polar researchers with a goal of integrating polar science research into K-12 curriculum. The potential return on investment of the proposed science is high in terms of advancing the state of knowledge in this area of science and the support of early career scientists and outreach aspects of the proposal are important to the NSF Mission and mandate.  For the past decade, the researchers have been developing an ice core array in the NE Pacific of the United States that targets the two nodes of this precipitation dipole (i.e., St. Elias Range and Central Alaska). The most recent ice core acquisition was in 2013 with the recovery of two surface-to-bedrock 210-meter ice cores from Mt. Hunter in Denali National Park.  To determine precipitation variability at the Mt. Hunter site over the past millennium, the researchers will rely on a suite of supporting geophysical data to constrain glacier geometry, velocity, boundary conditions, and rheological properties in a 3-dimensional finite element numerical model. The combined observational and model datasets will allow the team to remove influences of ice flow (which causes layer thinning) and spatial variability in snow accumulation rate to estimate temporal accumulation variability from the two ice cores.  In contrast to Mt. Hunter, little is known about the geophysical characteristics of the coastal St. Elias Range ice core sites (PR Col, NW Col, King Col on Mt Logan and the Eclipse Icefield), which were drilled in 2002 prior to recent advances in geophysical techniques and numerical modeling capability. This lack of information would introduce error in any comparison of the St. Elias and Mt. Hunter accumulation records, and thus evaluation of the MCA-LIA transition hypothesis.  Consequently, the research team specifically proposes to improve ice core-based accumulation records, and therefore hydroclimate reconstructions for the past millennium, in the NE Pacific through the collection of new geophysical data at existing ice core sites in the St. Elias Range. The science objectives are to: 1) develop bedrock topography maps of the Eclipse Icefield, King Col, and Mt. Logan summit plateau sites; 2) determine surface velocities at all sites; 3) map near-surface spatial accumulation rate patterns; 4) trace internal isochrones at all sites; 5) estimate ice deformation effects on layer thinning; 6) produce updated, to 2016, and corrected accumulation time series at all sites; and 7) compare corrected accumulation records from the Mt. Hunter and St. Elias sites to evaluate spatial precipitation patterns over the past millennium. The research strategy necessitates the use of state-of-the-art ground penetrating radar (GPR), geochemical, satellite remote sensing, numerical modeling, and data synthesis techniques.",2019-01-01T08:00:00Z,2019-03-15T22:25:45Z

To achieve these goals we conducted two years of fieldwork at Point Spencer, excavating one previously reported village site (TEL-8) and surveying to identify and investigate several other sites in the surrounding area.  We collected and analyzed animal bones, tools, and radiocarbon data to reconstruct past diet, season of site occupation, and settlement patterns at TEL-8 and across the local area.  We also conducted a geoarchaeological study focused primarily on establishing local coastal landscape evolution.   Prior research conducted in the 1940s suggested that we would encounter pre-1000 year old occupations at TEL-8, but excavation at the site did not locate any cultural materials dating before the Thule period (ca. 1000-250 years ago).  The other sites in the surrounding area all date to the Thule period.  Despite these challenges, our work makes several important contributions to Arctic archaeological research and to research on maritime hunter-gatherers.  Specifically, this project contributes new data on hunting and fishing activities over an approximately 1000 year period; zooarchaeological research in this region is limited so our new analysis provides important insights into past subsistence activities.  Settlement data suggests that local occupation intensified during the late pre-contact period, over the last 500 years, although additional research is needed to further evaluate the patterns we identified.  These findings differ from what is currently known about late pre-contact settlement patterns in northwest Alaska.  Lastly, geoarchaeological research established the potential of other regional landforms for archaeological sites dating both before and after the Neoeskimo transition beginning around 1000 years ago.",2018-04-17T07:00:00Z,2018-04-20T16:18:46Z

The U.S. National Ice Center (NIC) is an inter-agency sea ice analysis and forecasting center comprised of Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Defense/U.S. Navy, and Department of Homeland Security/U.S. Coast Guard components. Since 1972, NIC has produced Arctic and Antarctic sea ice charts. This data set is an Arctic sea ice concentration climatology derived from the NIC weekly or biweekly operational ice chart time series. The charts used in the climatology are from 1972 through 2004, and the monthly climatology products are median, maximum, minimum, first quartile, and third quartile concentrations, as well as frequency of occurrence of ice at any concentration for 33 year, 10 year, and 5 year periods. These climatologies and the charts from which they are derived are provided in 25 km EASE-Grid (Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid /gridded binary). Ice extent can be derived from concentration by summing the number of equal area EASE-Grid cells. GIF browse files are also provided. The climatologies are also made available in a Geographical Information System (GIS) compatible format. NIC charts are produced through the analyses of available in situ, remote sensing, and model data sources. They are generated primarily for mission planning and safety of navigation. NIC charts generally show more ice than do passive microwave derived sea ice concentrations, particularly in the summer when passive microwave algorithms tend to underestimate ice concentration. The record of sea ice concentration from the NIC series is believed to be more accurate than that from passive microwave sensors, especially from the mid-1990s on (see references in the documentation), but it lacks the consistency of some passive microwave time series.",2009-11-18T08:00:00Z,2016-09-21T22:27:28Z
doi:10.18739/A2K06X08R,Rebecca Hewitt,"Root profiles and 15N isotope uptake of tundra plants, Eight Mile Lake, Alaska 2015",isotope 15N moist acidic tundra roots,"Nontechnical  Release of carbon frozen in permafrost (frozen ground) has been identified as one of the strongest and most likely positive feedbacks between the biosphere and the warming climate. Permafrost nitrogen release has the potential to stabilize the response of the carbon cycle to climate warming because it is a negative, within-system feedback. It could confer resilience to ecosystem-atmosphere interactions in a warming Arctic. The research under this award will advance understanding of the arctic system by incorporating this feedback into a terrestrial biosphere model used extensively by the community for forecasting arctic environmental change and its links to the Earth system.  The collaborative nature of the project will build partnerships between ecosystem ecologists and molecular biologists, creating new knowledge about the role of plant-fungal mutualisms in Earth system feedback cycles. The project will support career development of two female arctic scientists at the postdoctoral or new faculty level. It will contribute to the training of two graduate students in biogeosciences, ecology, and molecular biology, and provide an authentic field or laboratory research experience for about twenty undergraduate students. The project will contribute to broadening participation of under-represented groups in ecological and environmental sciences.  Technical  About 1,700 Pg of organic carbon (C) reside in the permafrost soils and sediments of Arctic and Boreal regions. Because this stock is more than twice the size of the atmospheric C pool, there is considerable interest in understanding how the C balance of permafrost ecosystems will respond to observed and predicted climate warming. As permafrost soils thaw, organic matter that has been cryogenically protected for hundreds to thousands of years is exposed to microbial decomposition and released to the atmosphere as greenhouse gases. One key factor that may strongly influence C balance in these ecosystems is the concurrent release of nitrogen (N), the element most likely to limit plant productivity. Release of N at or after thaw could increase plant N availability, stimulate plant C uptake and offset or balance permafrost C emissions. Although scientists acknowledge the key role N is likely to play in the permafrost C feedback to climate, there have been few empirical studies of the factors that control its fate in warming permafrost ecosystems. The objective of this project is to develop a mechanistic understanding of the role of permafrost N in the C balance of Alaskan tundra landscapes underlain by permafrost soils.  The project will focus on plant acquisition of permafrost N because in most N-limited terrestrial ecosystems, plant uptake is the dominant fate of N released by microbial processes. Plants depend on fungal partners to access N beyond the reach of roots, so this research will also focus on plant mycorrhizal status and fungal community composition to elucidate the role fungal symbionts play in plant N acquisition. Finally, other fates of permafrost N will be explored, including stasis and loss. Proposed research will explore three general questions: What is the potential for release of plant-available nitrogen from thawing permafrost soil organic matter; what proportion of N released deep in the soil profile, at the base of the active layer, is acquired by mycorrhizae and plants and what are the key biotic and abiotic factors that control acquisition; and how will permafrost thaw and N release affect net ecosystem carbon balance and net biogeochemical radiative forcing from permafrost thaw at local and regional scales?  The research approach includes three elements: observations of plants, fungi and soils across a regional survey of upland tundra ecological landscape units on the North Slope of the Brooks Range, Alaska; occupying intensive research sites in cold and warm moist acidic tundra, where measurements of mycorrhizal fungi and plant N acquisition and N loss will be made within long-term warming experiments and well-characterized natural thaw gradients; and modeling and regional integration with a terrestrial biosphere model specifically developed to simulate C and N dynamics in high latitude systems.  We quantified root depth and biomass profiles for tundra plants in tussock- and shrub-dominated tundra plot at Eight Mile Lake near Healy, Alaska. We measured %C, %N, d13C, and d15N of aboveground and belowground plant material 24 hours after the addition of 250 mg of isotopically labeled 98 atom percent ammonium chloride.

The investigators will target seven rivers for sampling. River sampling will occur during different flow regimes, but will emphasize sample collection during the spring freshet, the time of year when terrestrial runoff from local CAA rivers maximally impacts coastal waters. Estuarine sampling will include both horizontal and vertical profiles. The data will be synthesized and interpreted using mixing models and regression analyses, and compared with data for the Mackenzie and Yukon Rivers, which have historically been considered ""typical"" for North American runoff to the Arctic. Acceleration of glacial melt and the hydrologic cycle in a warmer world will likely increase local inputs of freshwater to the CAA. Because many such changes may already be underway, it is important to establish a baseline by which future changes can be compared.

The objective is to investigate a number of important cloud-related processes, how these interact with the Arctic climate system, and their impact on the surface energy and mass budgets. Specific foci will include:

1) Low-cloud persistence mechanisms that lead to long-lived Arctic stratiform clouds, which interact strongly with the atmospheric structure and surface energy budget;

2) Cloud-phase partitioning, which determines the cloud microphysical composition and, ultimately, the effects that clouds have on atmospheric radiation and the hydrologic cycle; and

3) Precipitation partitioning, in order to understand the different modes of precipitation at Summit and how these impact the total surface accumulation.

To address these topics, this project will utilize detailed observations from a suite of ground-based remote sensors deployed at Summit as part of the NSF/AON-funded ICECAPS project in combination with data from satellite-borne active remote sensors. High-resolution numerical modeling will also be used to investigate many of the fine-scale cloud processes and their mesoscale influences. These studies over the Greenland Ice Sheet will also be considered within the context of similar measurements and model studies made at other Arctic locations in order to understand these important processes over Summit and, in a more general sense, across the Arctic.

Atmospheric water vapor, clouds, and precipitation greatly affect the surface energy and cryospheric mass balances in the Arctic, and are responsible for much of the variability in these balances. It is thought that recent rapid melting of Arctic sea ice may be driven, in part, by changes in cloud cover and radiation. Cloud-related processes and feedbacks are known to be one of the greatest sources of uncertainty in global climate models, and these shortcomings have been clearly identified in model simulations over the Arctic. Thus, the results of this project should improve our understanding of Arctic cloud processes and their inclusion in climate models, which, in turn, will improve predictability.

As broader impacts of this research, the project will provide important data analysis and integration experience for four new graduate students at the participating universities. In addition, data and results from this study will be integrated into undergraduate coursework and summer workshops for high school students and teachers.",2016-10-14T07:00:00Z,2018-05-14T18:29:36Z

We designed a Temperature Gradient Ice Core Transport System (TGICTS), named the ICE-MITT (Ice Core Extraction while Maintaining In-situ Temperature Transitions), with which we could transport cores from the field back to our lab at in-situ temperature gradients. It was only partially successful. We discovered that improvements needed to be made to the design of the device if it is to work for large cores (ours were 1 m x 14 cm diameter) and at non-freezing ambient temperatures. A later freezer failure at Dartmouth resulted in the loss of the cores that were transported with this device, leaving us with only cores that had been shipped back the traditional (isothermal) method (at a uniform -20C).  Samples from the ""isothermal"" cores were taken every 10 cm and analyzed using X-ray micro computed tomography in a -14C cold room. We used a Bruker Skyscan 1172 desktop micro computed tomography system and the associated proprietary reconstruction and postprocessing software. MicroCT data began as raw tiff X-ray images taken at a number of rotation steps (0.7 deg apart) between 0 and 180 deg. These were reconstructed into bitmap (bmp) slices of the sample. A volume of interest was selected and the data within it binarized by the use of thresholds to distinguish ice from air and brine. Binarized images of the slices of the VOI are also saved as bmp files.  We identified a set of metrics that can be gleaned from X-ray micro-computed tomography and are useful for interpreting the microstructure of sea ice (Lieb-Lappen et al., 2017). We have used these to quantify some differences in brine channel topology with depth, and some differences between granular and frazil ice.  Finally, we tested the Notz wire harp by cutting a hole in the ice cover in late February 2015 (Feb 14-19, 2015) and freezing the harp into it. Based on the principle that pure solid ice is a good insulator whereas interstitial saltwater brine is a good conductor, the device developed by Notz, Worster and Wettlaufer (Notz et al., 2005; Notz and Worster, 2008) records temperature and resistivity at different depths as ice grows around it. Salinity of the interstitial brine is then inferred from the liquidus relationship (Cox and Weeks, 1986) and can be combined with the measured solid mass fraction to give the bulk salinity profile of the growing sea ice. This was a preliminary test for later use of the harp on another project.  Notz, D., Wettlaufer, J. & Worster, M. (2005).

The FLASH research had two primary purposes: first, to locate, date, and characterize the nature of the activities performed at the fornbyli locations; and second, to describe and understand the sequences of soil erosion, sediment deposition, and landscape change that have occurred on Hegranes since the settlement of Iceland ca. 870 AD. Preliminary interpretations suggest that many fornbyli were inhabited early, that the sites were reused for multiple purposes after habitation ceased, through the medieval period and later, and that the overall landscape of Hegranes has been subject to significant erosion and alteration over the course of its history. Most of the fornbyli were inhabited prior to ca. 950 AD, and several of them were relatively large during the 10th and 11th centuries, comparable in size to farms that would later become much larger and more successful. Others seem only to have been inhabited for a short time, perhaps as a temporary or seasonal work site. None show evidence of habitation much after ca. 1104, and from that time until after the late 18th century, many of the sites were rebuilt as farm infrastructure for livestock management (stekkir and beitarhus, constructed between 1104 and the 19th century, are often still visible), only to be finally abandoned and fall to ruin before the 20th century. Preliminary environmental analysis suggests two significant periods of erosion: prior to 1104, and after 1766, roughly corresponding to the periods when the use of the sites was changing. Preliminary analysis of carbon content at nearby mires further suggests that wetlands were more likely to persist through time close to the sites than farther away, perhaps a result of intentional preservation to support wetland exploitation. Indeed, coring further shows that wetlands near most of the sites were exploited for peat and turf through most of their history.",2018-05-02T07:00:00Z,2018-05-02T23:25:25Z

Stakeholders in the Arctic and beyond are impacted by the cascading effects that these changes have on resource accessibility, ecosystem health, and earth?s physical climate system. Planning mitigation and adaptation strategies requires improvements in the ability to predict the arctic climate system. Confounding predictive model development are large gaps that remain in the understanding of the role albedo feedbacks are playing in sea ice loss.  This project will improve the understanding the impacts of solar energy absorption and partitioning on ice mass balance by tracking Arctic Observing Network (AON) sea ice sites as they move through space and time, using the rich datasets being collected at the sites as case studies. The approach integrates AON data with measurements from prior field campaigns, atmospheric reanalysis products, and high resolution remote sensing data using a 3D resolved sea ice-ocean mixed layer coupled model. The objectives are to quantify the deposition of solar energy within a 10x10km study domain around the sites with meter-scale resolution, identify the fate of that solar energy over time (e.g. ocean storage vs. ice bottom melt vs. lateral melt), and improve the ability of our resolved scale model to represent the processes controlling solar absorption and fate. The model explicitly represents critical ice and ocean processes such as melt pond formation, brine drainage, freshwater balance, and upper ocean stratification, providing a tool for data integration that can account for all first order processes impacting radiative transfer and heat storage. Important gaps in initialization datasets will be addressed by an ensemble modeling approach. Iterative comparison of site observations with model states will inform the selection of poorly constrained initial conditions, evaluate system sensitivity, and allow testing of improved model parameterizations for processes such as pond evolution.",2019-01-01T08:00:00Z,2019-03-08T19:09:50Z
doi:10.18739/A2901ZF74,Karen Frey,"Marine-terminating outlet glacier terminus positions, Disko and Uummannaq Bay, West Greenland, 1985-2015",Greenland outlet glaciers terminus mapping,"Recent changes, including the dramatic speedups of several large outlet glaciers, and increased rates of surface melting, have increased Greenland’s contribution to sea-level rise from near zero in the 1990s to a large negative imbalance today. Poor knowledge of the processes driving these changes is one of the main limitations on prediction of future ice sheet contributions to sea level rise. An increasing number of observations point towards the influence of coupled ocean-ice-atmospheric processes in modulating ice sheet mass balance and outlet glacier behavior, but most studies are limited to the past few decades restricting our ability to extrapolate these relationships over longer time periods, given their high inter-annual variability. Here, we used over 1200 Landsat images spanning all seasons between 1985–2015 to investigate the behavior of 17 marine-terminating glaciers that outlet into Disko and Uummannaq Bay, West Greenland by manually digitizing over 5000 individual frontal positions. The number of observations allowed for calculation of an annual range in terminus position as an estimate of seasonal variability. The high spatial and temporal resolution of our dataset allows for insights into the seasonal and long-term behavior of West Greenland outlet glaciers and will be particularly useful for future studies such as better defining individual fjord geometry controls, understanding inland propagation of disturbances at the glacier front, and predicting occurrence of future tipping points in terminus behavior.",2018-01-01T08:00:00Z,2018-10-30T20:13:19Z

The spatial variability and temporal evolution of snow depth is of fundamental interest. At the beginning of the experiment, we laid out five survey lines. Surveys of snow depth were routinely conducted along these lines throughout the SHEBA year. Measurements were made every 1-2 weeks from October through May and every other day from June through August. The surveys consisted of walking along a line and measuring snow depth every 1-5 m. Snow depth was measured either manually using a graduated ski pole or automatically using a magnaprobe. Manual measurements were rounded off to the nearest centimeter and magnaprobe values were accurate to better than 0.5 cm. Care was taken to repeat the surveys along the same lines, but no attempt was made to measure at exactly the same points.

Data was gathered from scientific literature descriptions of lake cores, peat cores underlain by lake sediments, and exposures within the domain of glaciation and permafrost extent during the Last Glacial Maximum. We distinguished eight classes of lake origin. Where not indicated by the author, we sought to determine lake origin from lithology, geological history and site descriptions within the text. Though most records (95%) were radiocarbon dated, we included robust dates obtained by a variety of methods including varve counting, photoluminescence, Pb/Cs, Th/U, wiggle matching and tephrochronology. We reported oldest sample ages in the majority of cases, electing not to utilize basal ages derived from age-depth models extrapolated beyond dated levels due to both their high level of uncertainty and differences between methodologies used to construct each model. We excluded dates from shallow lake cores that clearly did not reach basal lake sediments, or that were collected for the sole purpose of methods development or recent human impact studies. Records that did not include dates from lower-most cored sediments, that suffered from uncorrected reservoir effects (noted by original author) or that contained copious age reversals were also excluded. Some records provided distinct stratigraphic evidence of lake formation that allowed for exact determination of lake basal age, while other lithologies were more ambiguous. To address this uncertainty, we categorized each lake age as ""minimum"" or ""basal"" based on interpretation of contextual, geographical and lithological information.

doi:10.18739/A2N29P63K,Jennifer MacKinnon,"Microstructure  measurements from the Arcticmix cruise, Beaufort Sea, September 2015",Mixing,"This data is from the NSF funded ArcticMix experiment.  The award revolves around better understanding and prediction of the changing Arctic Ocean.  Most oceans are `stratified’ by temperature, meaning water density is controlled primarily by temperature. Most oceans have warm water near the surface and cold water at depth, because the cold water is denser and sinks.  The Arctic is unusual in that density is set primarily by salinity.  The near-surface water is often cold but fresh; the low salt content makes it quite light, despite its low temperature.  Below that there are several layers of water that are saltier (and hence denser), but can be significantly warmer than the surface.  This unusual layer structure allows the possibility of considerable heat being trapped at depth sub-surface. There  are several of these warm layers. In the Beaufort Sea, where this work was performed, there is often a layer of warm water between roughly 30 and 80 meters below the surface that is of Pacific origin; it has entered the Arctic through Bering Strait. Well below that (roughly 250-400 meters down) there is another warm layer coming from the Atlantic.  Historically, these sub-surface heat pockets were modest in temperature.  They were also fairly stable as they were usually isolated from storms by a cover of sea ice, lurking for years beneath the surface and circulating around basins, only very gradually releasing their heat.  In the New Arctic, several things are changing. First, the warmth of the sub-surface layers is increasing. Our focus is primarily on the Pacific origin water, the warmest variety of which is called Pacific Summer Water (PSW).  Several decades ago most of this water was of order 1 C.  More recent observations (including ours funded by this grant) have seen a new type of PSW arriving which is much, much warmer, up to 6 C.  Second, the rate at which this heat is turbulently mixed upwards may be changing, as the Arctic in general becomes more energetic with increasingly ice-free conditions.  A better understanding of both the processes that set this sub-surface heat structure and those which may turbulently mix the heat upwards, is crucial for improved forecast abilities for both the sea ice melt rate and a variety of other physical and ecosystem consequences.  The data in this file are measurements of the turbulent dissipation rate from a shear-probe equipped microstructure profiler. They were acquired with the 'Modular Microstructure Profiler' developed by Mike Gregg at the University of Washington and published using standard techniques.  Data format is consistent with that required by the NSF funded microstructure database at https://microstructure.ucsd.edu  Results from some analysis of this data (with further information on processing methods) are presented in:  Fine, E.

Jarvis Creek (634km2), which feeds the Delta and Tanana River in Interior Alaska, was studied as a proxy of the observed mountain glacier melting and permafrost degradation that has been documented across the Arctic region in recent decades. The specific objectives were to 1) assess the hydrologic fluxes (including streamflow source components), stores, pathways and the role of glacier wastage on watershed hydrology, through hydrologic and geochemical field measurements as well as numerical and statistical modeling; 2) quantify the effect of glaciers and permafrost on recent historical (1960-present) hydrologic fluxes and storage by combining remote sensing, field measurements of glacier mass balance, and hydrology with a heat- and mass transfer model, and 3) project the future hydrologic regime using custom-derived downscaled climate projections.

Extending 1800 km between the North American and Asian continents, the Aleutian Islands divide the northern Pacific Ocean from the Bering Sea. Given their unique subpolar location, their genesis on a volcanically- and seismically-active plate boundary, and their gradual colonization by humans during the past 9000 years, the Aleutian Islands are an excellent natural archaeological laboratory for tracking past: (1) human ecology, (2) subarctic human-environmental reciprocal relationships and, (3) geological influences, sometimes catastrophic, on human society. Host to some of the world's most active volcanoes, the Four Mountains provided a superlative opportunity to assess the development of prehistoric human risk management of, and adaptations to, environmental instability (climate change, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, sea level fluctuations) through deep time. Four Mountain prehistoric sites are highly significant in light of new geologic data indicating volcanic activity during human migration and societal development in the Aleutians. Extensive new radiocarbon, paleoenvironmental, and cultural data extracted from these sites yielded novel insights into North Pacific Rim regional interactions, Unangan coping mechanisms, changing subsistence, and adaptations during the prehistoric and European contact periods. The primary research goals in the Four Mountains region was understanding: (1) how human cultures and behavior have been shaped by Holocene climatic, biotic and geologic change; and (2) how human cultures have used and impacted biotic environments. Researchers tested and documented: a) relationships of and interactions among human groups who peopled the Aleutians, b) long-term change in Holocene environments and consequent change in terrestrial and marine animal populations and diversity, much of which constituted human resources; c) human responses to shifts in the distribution, diversity, and abundance of resources and, d) human coping mechanisms and resilience in the face of potentially catastrophic climatic and geological forces.",NA,2019-01-14T22:55:12Z

Furthermore, bridging the traditional gap between observationalists and modelers, it will undertake a pilot study for future AON observational strategies which must surely combine observations and high quality modeling. The effort continues and expands upon decades of measurements in the Bering Strait region and constitutes an NSF contribution to the interagency Russian-American Long-term Census of the Arctic (RUSALCA) partnership.  This is an archive of data from moorings deployed in Bering Strait from summer 2016 to summer 2017.

doi:10.18739/A2930NV02,Claudia Czimczik,"Thaw depth at Toolik Field Station, Alaska, 2017-2018",THAW DEPTH PERMAFROST ACTIVE LAYER,"Arctic soils contain very large amounts of organic carbon most of which is frozen in permafrost and has not participated in the global carbon cycle for thousands of years. Perturbations to carbon storage in permafrost soils have the potential to significantly increase the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and contribute to global climate change.  This data set reports the depth of thaw in the active layer of a permafrost soil near Toolik Field Station in moist acidic tussock tundra - a common tundra system in Northern Alaska. This data was collected in support of a project that aims to understand the sources of carbon dioxide emitted from Arctic tundra year-round. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas produced in soils by the respiration of roots and of microorganisms decomposing soil organic matter, and both processes are sensitive to changes in temperature and water content. Increases in carbon dioxide emissions can be related to increased plant productivity (photosynthesis and storage of carbon in plants and soils) or increased microbial activity (loss of carbon previously stored in soils). However, measuring the radiocarbon content (age) of carbon dioxide emissions can be used to understand how Arctic ecosystems are responding to climate change, because roots and microorganisms respire carbon with distinct isotopic signatures.  In this project, our team built and deployed new technology to characterize the sources of carbon emissions from Arctic tundra year-round, with a special focus on winter emissions. Specifically, we developed a sampling system that continuously collects carbon dioxide over a period of 1-4 weeks. The system is passive (no power requirements, ambient pressure and temperature), rugged (suitable for well-aerated, waterlogged, and frozen soils), light-weight (<0.5 kg/sample), and isotopically-clean (i.e. the recovered carbon dioxide is suitable for radiocarbon analysis and the sampler itself does not emit carbon).  The samples are shipped to the W. M. Keck Carbon Cycle Accelerator Mass Spectrometer facility at the University of California, Irvine, where they are analyzed for their radiocarbon content. Their isotopic information allows us to elucidate which soil carbon pools are being consumed by microorganism during the winter, and to quantify what proportion of the carbon originates from microorganisms decomposing organic matter (as opposed to from the roots of plants that are fixing carbon from the atmosphere) during the summer.",2018-01-01T08:00:00Z,2019-01-31T17:38:48Z

The near-ice observations and subglacial discharge routing indicate that runoff from this glacier occurs primarily at two discrete locations and gives rise to two distinct glacially modified waters.

For tidewater glaciers, large and rapid changes in glacier volume can occur independent of climate change due to strong glacier dynamic feedbacks. Using an idealized tidewater glacier model, we show that these feedbacks produce secular variations in subglacial discharge and submarine melting that are influenced by subglacial topography.",2017-11-14T08:00:00Z,2020-05-21T20:46:49Z

The hydraulic properties of glaciers are a major factor influencing the rate at which glaciers slide on the underlying rock. Understanding subglacial flow is critical to developing models that accurately predict how glaciers will behave in response to warming climate and how glaciers will contribute to sea level rise. For outreach and educational purposes, the project has developed a web-based, interactive fluid dynamics tutorial concerning subglacial conduits. A project web site was also be developed. The project contributes to workforce development by supporting the training of a graduate student and by providing partial support for three early-career scientists.  This study performed three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and large eddy simulations (LES) of turbulent flows in a subglacial conduit using realistic surfaces and mesh boundaries. The computations were done using 3D high-performance computing. The conduit geometry and roughness was based on a unique set of field measurements made on a Svalbard glacier using a modified video-game controller at mm resolution. The result of this effort is a first-ever high resolution visualization of a real subglacial conduit and the first subglacial LES simulations with realistic geometry. Results were compared with model output using the more standard Darcy-Weisbach or Manning formulations. The study provides improved insights into hydrological processes in mountain glaciers and large ice sheets such as the Greenland Ice Sheet.

Previous studies suggested that this enhancement is associated with the local equatorial wind dynamo, the same process used to explain the pre-reversal enhancement after sunset. However, this hypothesis has never been tested in a first-principles way. In this study, we explore the physical mechanisms responsible for the sunrise enhancement of equatorial upward vertical drifts using the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model. The model well reproduces the sunrise enhancement of upward vertical drifts observed at Jicamarca on 10 June 2004. The simulation results show that large eastward zonal electric fields occur around sunrise at all latitudes, but with a peak at middle latitudes. Further numerical experiments reveal that the equatorial sunrise enhancement is primarily driven by the E-region zonal wind dynamo at middle latitudes rather than by the local dynamo effect in the equatorial region. Specifically, the corresponding eastward electric field at sunrise is generated by westward winds with longitudinal gradients at middle-latitudes.",2020-01-01T08:00:00Z,2020-06-09T06:33:42Z

We proposed a study of snow drifts. Drifts can comprise more than half of the local snow water equivalent (SWE) and play a large and widely overlooked role in snow hydrology. They melt slowly, resulting in a crucial shift in the timing of water delivery that syncs snow melt directly to agricultural and ecosystem needs, yet we know little about drifts on either local or global scales. The overall goal of the research was to better understand the role and importance of snow drifts in hydrology. Using lidar and structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry, we conducted an airborne study of drifts coupled with extensive ground validation in search of preliminary answers to questions on the importance of drifts and the percentage of SWE found in drifts in a variety of terrain types."",

The area mapped each year over two swaths was about 130 kilometer squared (km^2). To produce the maps, we: (1) conducted an airborne survey (snow-free) in June that was used to produce a snow-free digital elevation model (DEM) for each swath, (2) conducted airborne surveys at near-peak snow cover each April that were used to create digital surface models (DSMs) of the snow cover, then (3) generated annual high resolution (1 m) snow depth maps by subtracting the snow-free DEM from the DSMs. Six such depth maps were produced for each swath between 2012 and 2018, comprising over 600 million individual geospatial snow depth records. Acquiring the snow-free DEM required careful timing because tundra plants leaf out before all snowdrifts melt. The snow depth maps were field-validated and adjusted using 141,207 ground-based probe measurements collected concurrently with the airborne surveys."",

Eighty years later, the IMO initiated a process to manage shipping in ice-covered oceans. In concert with the IMO Guidelines for Ships Operating in Arctic Ice-Covered Waters in 2002 and their 2004 release of the Arctic 2004 Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, the Arctic Council initiated the Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment (AMSA), which issued its final report in 2009. The goal of this chapter is to build on AMSA as a case study of informed decisionmaking through the steps of questions to generate data, which are then integrated into evidence to reveal options (without advocacy), informing decisions by relevant institutions to address a ‘continuum of urgencies’ that involve shipping in the new Arctic Ocean with its transformed sea-ice cap, assessing whether shipping is increasing as sea ice is decreasing (‘ship-ice hypothesis’). Primary sources of data for AMSA involved ship tracking from ground-station Automatic Identification System (AIS), shore-based radar systems and details of fishing vessels as well as other smaller ships provided by the Arctic nations. However, Arctic ship traffic fundamentally changed the year of the AMSA report, when satellite AIS records began providing continuous, synoptic, pan-Arctic coverage of individual ships with data pulsed over seconds to minutes. This chapter reveals the oldest and longest continuous satellite AIS record (from 1 September 2009 through 31 December 2016), applying the ‘spacetime cube’ (which also was unavailable during AMSA) with more than 120,000,000 satellite AIS messages from SpaceQuest Ltd. to begin addressing synoptic questions with any level of granularity from points to regions to pan-Arctic over time. Future questions can be considered to assess ship attributes (including vessel flag state, size and type) in view of biophysical and socio-economic variables, recognizing that shipping and sea ice are recognized as primary drivers of change in the Arctic Ocean. Contributions to these assessments come from all areas of science (inclusively defined as the study of change), across the natural and social sciences with Indigenous knowledge in an holistic (international, interdisciplinary and inclusive) manner to achieve Arctic sustainability across generations. As a practical outcome in a user-defined manner, this chapter reveals characteristics of next-generation Arctic marine shipping assessments, revealing patterns and trends that can be applied to informed decisionmaking about the governance mechanisms and built infrastructure as well as operations for multilateral stability and sustainable development in the new Arctic Ocean.",2020-01-01T08:00:00Z,2020-08-20T08:10:56Z

This analysis will inform response strategies and planning by developing new methods of hazard assessment that can support community resilience in the North Slope and potentially serve as a model for advancing assessment and planning in other rural and urban communities. This research will expand traditional assessments of financial exposure to also include non-material factors such as values and priorities of diverse social groups within a community including a diverse set of stakeholders, ranging from multinational oil companies to individual subsistence hunters. This study surveys community views of asset importance and integrates results with a geophysical hazard data model for a coproduced community exposure map of the North Slope coast. This research will contribute to understanding the human and social dimensions of climate change impacts, including how social, economic, political, and cultural factors shape vulnerabilities and condition response strategies. Methods and findings could enhance nation-wide efforts in the United States to map community exposure to coastal climate hazards by demonstrating methods for, and the importance of systematically incorporating non-market values in exposure analysis.

The objectives of the proposed research include adapting the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) coastal vulnerability index (CVI) to the Arctic context, and integrating results with formal asset databases and a spatial community landscape value model while working with affected communities during the process to coproduce exposure maps. Specifically, working with North Slope Alaskan communities the study will incorporate wind fetch (i.e., the open water distance over which wind can generate near shore waves, determined by sea ice extent) into the CVI and get community feedback on the results. In addition to community input on the CVI maps, coproducing the exposure maps includes the community assigning values to traditional land use places using existing spatial datasets and mapping and investigating specific sites threatened by coastal hazards with the aim to learn why exposed assets threaten the community.",2017-02-28T08:00:00Z,2020-07-16T21:41:14Z

Three August-September cruises, one every two years, will be conducted, with extensive measurements along continental margins, a boundary current conduit; cruises will cover vast areas from Svalbard to the East Siberian Sea. The program ties together oceanographic, chemical, and ice observations using moorings, repeated oceanographic sections, and Lagrangian drifters to provide vital information about Arctic Ocean changes. The overarching goal of the study as an AON element is to compile a cohesive picture of the state and transformations of Atlantic Water (AW) in the EMB, with particular focus on three major observational targets: (1) along-slope AW transport by the boundary currents (2) interaction of AW branches with shelf waters, deep basin interior and upper ocean (3) EMB indications of changes in the upper ocean circulation. The proposed targets are broad in scope and pose a wide range of challenges to modern high-latitude observational oceanography. The EMB's size and location mean that this part of the Arctic Ocean is representative of pan-arctic conditions and processes, and therefore appropriate for long-term observing. Therefore, the project is an important element of the pan-AON. Graduate students will be supported; female and Alaska Native students will be encouraged to participate. Program outreach will culminate in 2013 with a shipboard summer school. Data and products, critically-needed benchmarks for Arctic satellite sea-ice and altimeter measurements, will be available per AON data policy.",2016-07-20T07:00:00Z,2020-07-15T23:35:46Z

doi:10.18739/A2RN3081R,Hajo Eicken,The State of the Arctic Sea Ice Cover: Sustaining the integrated seasonal ice zone observing network,AON,"In a rapidly changing Arctic, the shrinking and thinning sea-ice cover plays an important role as indicator and agent of environmental change. A dramatic shrinking of the perennial ice cover has greatly increased the extent and hence importance of the Arctic seasonal ice zone (SIZ). The SIZ is predicted to occupy much of the Arctic by mid- to late century, but data are sorely lacking to aid in tracking, understanding and predicting change over this important component of the Arctic cryosphere. This interdisciplinary project implements an integrated program for observing seasonal ice in the context of sweeping environmental, (geo)political and socio-economic change in the North. In addition to sampling of sea-ice state variables, the observation-system design is guided by the concept of sea-ice system services (SISS). By assessing the nature and extent of SISS, an integrated observation network can be built that will lead to prediction of key trends in a changing Arctic in a way that provides maximum benefit for the broadest range of affected interests. The project's overarching scientific goal is to track intertwined changes and selected important impacts in a rapidly evolving Seasonal Ice Zone (SIZ) in order to improve our understanding and predictions of the Arctic sea-ice cover over the course of the century. The project will establish a network of researchers, Arctic residents, different institutions with needs for sea-ice information, and other stakeholders. It will deliver infrastructure and an integrated sea-ice data set, leaving a legacy that allows for continued, long-term observations beyond the International Polar Year (IPY) test bed. Specific objectives are to: (1) Identify a set of sea-ice variables that helps answer the key scientific questions and is of greatest value to the stakeholder communities while being operationally tractable. (2) Provide a framework for assessing sea-ice observations during IPY in the context of large-scale spatial and temporal variability. (3) Create a protocol for integrated sea ice observations. Drawing on results from aims #1 and 2, an observation protocol will be developed to guide ice observations during the IPY and beyond. (4) Complete a series of networked, integrated pan-Arctic SIZ observations, and disseminate the data to relevant user and stakeholder groups through appropriate archival and distribution centers. This effort will involve partners from six nations and draw on existing resources and programs already in place. (5) Analyze observations in a dialog with potential users, aimed at refining the observation strategy to create a legacy network for the post-IPY phase. As data from the first season are available, a dialog with representatives of key user groups will take place, aimed at improving the scope and mode of data collection and dissemination. At the end of the project, based on the data sets assembled, an IPY legacy observing network that will rely on a combination of autonomous sensors, local observers and continuing operational and scientific efforts will be outlined. Funds are provided to build on activities of the Seasonal Ice Zone Observing Network (SIZONet). SIZONet Phase I led to the development of the sea-ice system services (SISS) concept, describing societal benefits (and potentially negative impacts) derived from the ice cover. By assessing the nature and extent of SISS, the PIs are able to build a sea-ice observing network that is responsive to the needs of both the scientific community and key stakeholders. SIZONet builds on collaboration with several international partners, and spans the entire latitudinal extent of the Arctic seasonal ice zone (SIZ). Based on common protocol and coordinated observation strategies developed in the context of an international working group led by the project team, SIZONet Phase II refines and narrows the scope of the project and focuses on sustaining core observations. The aim is to provide data and information to scientists and stakeholders that: (1) address the most urgent information needs identified by the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) and related efforts; (2) meet sea-ice user information needs, centering on access, use of ice as a platform, and ice as coastal hazard and regulator of coastal erosion; (3) contribute to development of down-scaling approaches for climate modeling and remote sensing; and (4) are directly tied to SISS, allowing existing collaborations to grow into partnerships that can help track and predict Arctic environmental change and meet long-term information needs. Observations include shore-based and drift-ice measurements of ice motion, key mass-balance variables and critical snow and ice properties such as albedo, as well as airborne ice thickness and property surveys. Measurements in coastal ice, of greatest interest to key stakeholders, include hydrographic moorings, survey measurements and integration of satellite imagery. Local ice observations and joint ice-trail mapping provide a link between sea-ice geophysics and indigenous sea-ice expertise. All SIZONet data is ingested into an archival and dissemination system linked to the Alaska Ocean Observing System, the Geographic Information Network of Alaska, and the Cooperative Arctic Data and Information System.",2009-11-18T08:00:00Z,2020-07-15T17:59:09Z

To understand the influences of burial rate and history, ice impurities, as well as drilling and analytical techniques on ice core gas concentrations, the proposed project will further refine and improve new methods for continuous gas measurements and use these improved methods to analyze gases and aerosols in ice core samples from three widely distributed sites in northern Greenland: Tunu, D4, and NGRIP. All are located in the cold, dry snow zone, but each has a different annual accumulation rate and is influenced by different aerosol sources and transport pathways. Two sites previously were used for firn gas studies which will provide needed controls for firn and gas-entrapment modeling. Archived core samples are available for D4 and NGRIP, but a new core from the Tunu site is required. The proposed measurements will utilize the Desert Research Institute's (DRI's) continuous-flow analysis with trace elements system capable of quantifying dust, sea salt, biomass burning, and volcanic aerosols. This system was recently expanded to include continuous gas measurements being developed and refined by Oregon State University (OSU), DRI, and other international collaborators under an NSF Partnerships in International Research and Education (PIRE) grant primarily focused on student participation and international collaborations rather than research. The proposed project will extend past K-12 and other outreach strategies, including coordination and development of activities with outreach specialists at the Ice Drilling Program Office.

Beryllium-10 is produced by cosmic rays in exposed rock. The premise of this investigation is that Be-10 accumulates in surface rock during times of ice-sheet retreat and is eroded and deposited in marine sediment during times of ice-sheet growth. The isotopic time series will include Pleistocene and Pliocene sediment stretching back 4 to 6 million years, possibly beyond the onset of continental-scale glaciation in Greenland. The investigators hope to 1) constrain the time at which continental glaciation on Greenland began, 2) estimate the relative areal extent of the ice sheet through time, 3) determine the erosivity and sediment transport efficiency of the ice sheet, and 4) constrain the erosion rate of Greenland prior to the onset of glaciation. Understanding Greenland Ice Sheet dynamics in the past (particularly the extent of deglaciation and the timescale of regrowth) is key to understanding how the ice sheet might behave in the future. A central part of the project is the training of a young postdoctoral research associate, and two undergraduate students will work on the project as well.",2016-12-14T08:00:00Z,2020-07-15T19:23:16Z

POPs travel globally in air and water, are often highly bioaccumulative, and have the ability to cycle among environmental media enabling long-range transport to remote regions such as the Arctic. The investigators will use a modeling approach to provide insight into the relative importance of changing primary anthropogenic emissions and oceanic biogeochemical processes in controlling the fate and lifetime of POPs in the Arctic Ocean. The research will focus on two classes of compounds (polyfluorinated compounds - PFCs - and polychlorinated biphenyls - PCBs) with contrasting physical and chemical properties affecting behavior and reactivity in the atmosphere and ocean. The investigators will also collect new data on depth profiles of PCBs and two PFCs - perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanate (PFOA) - in the Arctic Ocean. Three main objectives will be addressed in the proposed research:

1) Quantify the global and regional atmospheric budget of PCBs and PFCs, including relevant spatially-varying uncertainties 

2) Quantify the budget of PCBs and PFCs in the Arctic Ocean, including inputs from atmospheric deposition, riverine inflows, and ocean cycling 

3) Quantify the relative importance of atmospheric, oceanic, and riverine inputs of PFOA, PFOS and PCBs to the Arctic, including the influence of climate and emissions. 
Ultimately this project will improve knowledge of how these compounds reach the Arctic and inform environmental management. The broader impacts component of the project will have three main goals: (1) Provide policy-relevant information to the Stockholm Convention and other international agreements on POPs to support monitoring and evaluation efforts for its controls on PCBs and PFOS and related compounds; (2) Inform sustainability education, by developing a case study on emerging POPs in the Arctic for courses relevant to environmental sustainability; and (3) train the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists (one graduate student will be trained at each of the three collaborating institutions).",2016-12-15T08:00:00Z,2020-07-15T19:32:02Z

The main goal of this project is to reconstruct the history of precipitation in Alaska during the last thousand years using ice core records of snow accumulation. The researchers plan to collect several new ice cores from the Mt. Hunter Plateau in the Alaska Range of Denali National Park and the new ice cores will be combined with an existing spatial array of ice cores in the region to map changes in the spatial patterns of precipitation. Because changes in atmospheric circulation patterns caused by ENSO and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) affect where the precipitation falls, this spatial array of ice cores will provide a record of how these larger scale climate systems have varied during the last thousand years. The project will focus on determining the differences in the precipitation patterns at the Little Ice Age (approximately 200 to 600 years ago) and Medieval Climate Anomaly (approximately 800 to 1,200 years ago).

This project will evaluate how changes in the climate state affect atmospheric circulation and precipitation.

Estimates of basal sliding generally result from an inverse analysis of observed surface motion using a model assuming Glen's generalized constitutive law for isotropic ice. Evidence suggests that this law does not adequately represent ice deformation, due to a variety of issues including ice thermal variations, preferred fabric, and chemical impurities in the ice. The PIs propose an innovative experimental design to improve our understanding of the ice deformation and sliding. A grid of 9 boreholes, each approximately 750 meters in depth and extending to the bed, will be drilled through the Greenland Ice Sheet and instrumented with more than 675 sensors to observe ice temperature, ice deformation, and basal sliding. Analysis of the resulting data set will yield the full three-dimensional velocity field and full stress and strain rate tensors for a 420x106 cubic meter block of ice. The results will be used to assess and improve the constitutive law and will provide a data set for testing inversion methodologies.  The Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets contain enough water to cause massive inundation of heavily populated coastal regions and associated infrastructure, if they were to degrade significantly through melting or delivery of icebergs to the coastal ocean. Our ability to predict future sea level rise is hampered by an inability to accurately model glacier dynamics that connect these ice sheets to the ocean.

The first hypothesis will explore the seasonal relationship between air temperature, river ice thickness, and winter runoff, while the second will investigate the contribution of thawing permafrost to river discharge. Research will focus on several river basins and feeder streams within the Russian Arctic and sub-Arctic where hydrometeorological measurements have been collected since 1950 and climate data are available from a number of global data archives. These data sets will be augmented by new field data collected by the PI team, focusing on permafrost, isotopic, hydrochemical, and higher time and spatial resolution hydrologic sampling. This suite of measurements will be used to test the hypotheses using watershed scale models and the Geophysical Institute Permafrost Lab model coupled to the Water Balance and Discharge Transformation Model (WBMplus). Graduate students and an undergraduate will receive training in fieldwork and modeling, and the grant will support an early career principal investigator. Results and methodology will also be incorporated into courses taught at the awardee institutions as well as through minority high school outreach programs. During fieldwork, an ongoing collaboration with residents near Igarka will be maintained and materials provided for their local permafrost museum.",2016-09-23T07:00:00Z,2020-07-15T18:53:10Z

This goal will be addressed with
                the powerful datasets derived from radiocarbon-dated vegetation preserved beneath ice caps for centuries to millennia, but now being exposed annually by current ice-margin retreat across northeastern Canada and West Greenland. These chronologies
                define the pattern and timing of abrupt summer coolings in the recent past and place current warming in a millennial context. 14C dating of vegetation will be complemented by measuring in situ 14C inventories in recently exposed rock surfaces,
                providing essential temporal constraints on the duration of ice-covered and ice-free conditions throughout the Holocene. Combined, these two datasets will provide the most secure evidence for the character of current summer warming by explicitly
                dating when the region was last as warm as present. Comparing our climate reconstructions with on-going studies in NW Europe will help to separate the roles of unforced variability from hemispherically symmetric forcing as causes for abrupt climate

To do this a critical first step will involve understanding the conditions under which surface aerosol conditions, as generally used in the compilation of statistical datasets addressing this issue, are comparable to those at cloud level. Using a variety of techniques, the distinction between surface-coupled and decoupled cloud states will focus evaluation of aerosol-cloud interactions on appropriate cases, reducing statistical contamination. From these cases, a statistical evaluation will be performed to reveal co-variation between key cloud (e.g. liquid water path, ice water path) and aerosol (e.g. concentration, size, hygroscopicity) properties. Combined with surface radiation measurements and idealized radiative transfer simulations, the results from this evaluation will provide an improved estimate of the net radiative impact of aerosols on Arctic clouds. Additionally, it will provide an overview of the seasonal evolution and surface-state dependence of these relationships. Outreach plans include several visits to Arctic regions, with a focus on the North Slope of Alaska and Greenland. The primary aim of these visits is to disseminate information relevant to the proposed research to seminar audiences consisting of local people (including underrepresented native people), primary school students, and local officials. A secondary aim of these visits is to give Arctic researchers (particularly early career researchers) who have never had a chance to visit the Arctic themselves an opportunity to see firsthand the region on which their efforts focus.

The main goal of the NABOS project is to provide quantitative assessment of circulation and water mass transformation along the principal pathways transporting water from the Nordic Seas to the Arctic Basin. Specific feature of this cruise was that it took place under conditions of substantially reduced summer ice cover over the major part of the Arctic Ocean. Reduced sea ice causes changes in the water column and in the overlying atmosphere. Documenting of these changes was the main target of the NABOS 2013 cruise. The scope of this goal and the opportunities of extended scientific research in the Arctic, provided during NABOS expeditions, encouraged scientific institutions from the US, Europe and Asia to raise funds, contribute to the cruise program and to send their personnel to the expedition, thus giving it a true multidisciplinary status. The information collected during the cruise is unique and very valid for understanding of the Arctic climate change. Important outreach component of the cruise was the Summer School, which provided an excellent opportunity for graduate students, PhD students and early career scientists from US, Europe, and Russia to learn about climate change in the Arctic and to participate in field experiments onboard.",2016-07-20T07:00:00Z,2020-07-15T23:06:44Z

Recent studies suggest that rapid ice loss is expanding northwards into NW Greenland, as demonstrated by the dramatic August, 2010 calving event from Petermann Glacier. However, little paleoclimate and ice sheet research has been conducted in NW Greenland, despite the proximity to a logistics center at Thule Air Base. The proposed research integrates multiple climate proxies and glaciological modeling experiments in the Thule region with the following research objectives:

1) Reconstruct Holocene climate in NW Greenland via inferences from reconstructed local ice cap extents (North Ice Cap, Tuto Ice Cap), ice core stable isotope and precipitation records, and data from nearby lake sediments. 

2) Examine the sensitivity of the NW Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) to Holocene climate changes by developing the history of the areal extent of the GIS and synthesizing proxy data with glaciological modeling experiments to examine past GIS changes and predict future GIS retreat.

Results from the proposed research will enable a more accurate prediction of the NW Greenland cryospheric response to a future warmer world and provide information directly relevant to predictions of future sea-level rise. The investigators propose to enhance public outreach and K-12 science education through development of educational modules using simplified, web-based, climate and glaciological models.

To fill this need, the Firn Compaction Verification and Reconnaissance (FirnCover) dataset comprises daily firn-compaction measurements from 49 strainmeters installed in boreholes at 10 accumulation sites on the Greenland ice sheet between 2013 and 2019. Two-meter air temperature and snow depth at each station were also recorded and are included with the dataset.

An important part of Arctic ecosystems and Aboriginal livelihood, wild reindeer have been monitored by scientists for almost 50 years. During this time, herds have exhibited large changes in size and these changes have been recorded in almost all herds across the animal's range. The increase in the number of wild reindeer 20-30 years ago was almost universally followed by a significant population loss in the last decade. In addition, recent monitoring revealed substantial shifts in the distribution of wild populations. The decline in wild reindeer is likely related to natural cycles and changes in the Arctic environment caused by climate change and increased anthropogenic activity. In order to explain the observed changes in the abundance and distribution of reindeer, it is necessary to collect long-term and seasonal observations. The Taimyr Reindeer Herd (TRH) is both the largest and the longest monitored wild reindeer herd in Eurasia. The Extreme North Agricultural Research Institute in Norilsk, Russia, has observed the TRH since 1969. Only a limited amount of the information on the TRH has been released, digitized, processed, analyzed or published. Much of the information is held in single-copy paper in locations and under conditions that threaten its longevity. The proposed project aims to digitize all available past records concerning the Taimyr wild reindeer populations and develop related datasets on climate and habitat over the decades of observation.  The Taimyr Reindeer Migration Reanalysis (TAMARA) project will be based upon a collaborative and integrated interdisciplinary international network of reindeer experts, arctic researchers, and geospatial scientists. The project is designed to build a comprehensive and openly available information system that will provide insight into the historical relationship between humans, climate, environment, and reindeer. Building on both international and local experiences the investigators will implement a major data digitization and dissemination effort that will be a considerable contribution to the polar cyberinfrastructure pertaining to Arctic terrestrial mammals. The project has the following objectives: 1) Retrieve, digitize, archive, transfer, process and publish historical observational data collected between 1969 and 2009, document relevant methodologies, and develop appropriate metadata; 2) Develop value-added data products resulting from the (re)analysis of historical spatial migration patterns of the TRH; and 3) Contribute to developing polar spatial cyberinfrastructure by creating a comprehensive and open data visualization and data dissemination system.

One intriguing, but not fully understood, feature of the early to mid-Pliocene climate is the amplified Arctic temperature response and its impact on Arctic ecosystems. Only the most recent models appear to correctly estimate the degree of warming in the Pliocene Arctic and validation of the currently proposed feedbacks is limited by scarce terrestrial records of climate and environment. Here we reconstruct the summer temperature and fire regime from a subfossil fen-peat deposit on west–central Ellesmere Island, Canada, that has been chronologically constrained using cosmogenic nuclide burial dating to 3.9+1.5/−0.5 milliampere.  The estimate for average mean summer temperature is 15.4±0.8 Celsius degree using specific bacterial membrane lipids, i.e., branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers. This is above the proposed threshold that predicts a substantial increase in wildfire in the modern high latitudes. Macro-charcoal was present in all samples from this Pliocene section with notably higher charcoal concentration in the upper part of the sequence. This change in charcoal was synchronous with a change in vegetation that included an increase in abundance of fire-promoting Pinus and Picea. Paleo-vegetation reconstructions are consistent with warm summer temperatures, relatively low summer precipitation and an incidence of fire comparable to fire-adapted boreal forests of North America and central Siberia.  To our knowledge, this site provides the northernmost evidence of fire during the Pliocene.

doi:10.18739/A2P55DH4M,Michael Ricketts,Soil bacterial community and functional shifts in response to altered snow pack in moist acidic tundra of Northern Alaska,NA,"Soil microbial communities play a central role in the cycling of carbon (C) in Arctic tundra ecosystems, which contain a large portion of the global C pool. Climate change predictions for Arctic regions include increased temperature and
                precipitation (i.e. more snow), resulting in increased winter soil insulation, increased soil temperature and moisture, and shifting plant community composition. We utilized an 18-year snowfence study site designed to examine the effects of increased
                winter precipitation on Arctic tundra soil bacterial communities within the context of expected ecosystem response to climate change. Soil was collected from three pre-established treatment zones representing varying degrees of snow accumulation
                (DEEP, INT, LOW), soil physical properties (temperature, moisture, active layer thaw depth) were measured, and samples were analysed for C concentration, nitrogen (N) concentration, and pH. Soil microbial community DNA was extracted and the 16S rRNA
                gene was sequenced to reveal phylogenetic community differences between samples and determine how soil bacterial communities might respond (structurally and functionally) to changes in winter precipitation and soil chemistry. We analysed relative
                abundance changes of the six most abundant phyla (ranging from 82-96% of total detected phyla per sample) and found four (Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Chloroflexi) responded to deepened snow. All six phyla correlated with
                at least one of the soil chemical properties (%C, %N, C:N, pH), however a single predictor was not identified suggesting that each bacterial phylum responds differently to soil characteristics. Overall bacterial community structure (beta
                diversity) was found to be associated with snow accumulation treatment and all soil chemical properties. Bacterial functional potential was inferred using ancestral state reconstruction to approximate functional gene abundance, revealing a decreased
                abundance of genes required for soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition in the organic horizon of the deep snow accumulation zones. These results suggest that predicted climate change scenarios may result in altered soil bacterial community structure
                and function, and indicate either a reduction in decomposition potential, or alleviated temperature limitations on extracellular enzymatic efficiency, or both. The fate of stored C in Arctic soils ultimately depends on the balance between these

doi:10.18739/A2319S373,Patrick Sullivan,"Winter snow depth as a driver of microbial activity, nutrient cycling, tree growth and treeline advance in the Arctic",Arctic Boreal Treeline White spruce Snow Microbe Nitrogen Phosphorus Carbon,"Overview:  It has long been thought that temperature exerts a direct control on growth of treeline trees and the position of the treeline.  However, our recent work in the Arctic with white spruce suggests that indirect effects of temperature on soil nutrient availability may be of equal or greater importance. We hypothesize that cold soils at the treeline, particularly during winter, limit microbial activity and nutrient availability to the point where trees are barely able to survive and grow. Measurements made during winter have revealed that Arctic forests maintain snowpacks that are much deeper than observed at treeline. Trees are thought to trap snow and lead to a deeper snowpack, insulating the soil from cold air and allowing for greater overwinter microbial activity and greater nutrient mineralization. Indeed, we found a strong positive correlation between white spruce growth and winter snow depth. We propose to isolate the mechanisms underlying this correlation by using snowfences to manipulate winter snow depth and fertilizer to increase soil nutrient availability at three treelines that differ in soil moisture. To provide an experimental test of the importance of temperature as a direct control on treeline tree growth, we propose to incorporate experimental shoot warming into our snowfence experiment in a factorial design. We predict that both experimental snow and nutrient additions will lead to large increases in microbial activity, photosynthesis, tree growth, seed quality, seed production, seedling establishment and recruitment of new trees. We expect to observe the greatest positive responses where soils are wet and cold.  Meanwhile, we predict that shoot warming will lead to negligible changes in growth. This research will elucidate the relationship between snow depth and soil nutrient availability, and determine the relative importance of nutrient and temperature limitations at treeline to white spruce – a dominant member of the boreal forest and the northernmost tree species in North America.  Intellectual Merit:  The position of the Arctic treeline is an important regulator of surface energy budgets, carbon cycling and subsistence resources in high latitude environments. Our recent research provides correlative evidence of the importance of winter snow depth as a driver of tree growth. Here, we propose to experimentally isolate the importance of snow depth and soil nutrient availability and examine the consequences for microbial processes and tree performance. This is a novel proposal, as we aim to link microbial ecology with large-scale landscape patterns of relevance to regional and global climates. If our hypotheses are confirmed, our findings will contradict the prevailing theory of treeline causation, alter our predictions of where and when treelines may advance and necessitate revision of the many paleoclimate reconstructions based upon correlations between temperature and tree growth near the Arctic treeline.",2020-01-01T08:00:00Z,2020-09-08T17:17:36Z

Documenting the changes that have already occurred is essential to inform management approaches to minimize the impacts of future activities. Here, we determine the cumulative geoecological effects of 62 years (1949-2011) of infrastructure- and climate-related changes in the Prudhoe Bay Oilfield, the oldest and most extensive industrial complex in the Arctic, and an area with extensive ice-rich permafrost that is extraordinarily sensitive to climate change. We demonstrate that thermokarst has recently affected broad areas of the entire region, and that a sudden increase in the area affected began shortly after 1990 corresponding to a rapid rise in regional summer air temperatures and related permafrost temperatures. We also present a conceptual model that describes how infrastructure-related factors, including road dust and roadside flooding are contributing to more extensive thermokarst in areas adjacent to roads and gravel pads. We mapped the historical infrastructure changes for the Alaska North Slope oilfields for 10 dates from the initial oil discovery in 1968-2011. By 2010, over 34% of the intensively mapped area was affected by oil development. In addition, between 1990 and 2001, coincident with strong atmospheric warming during the 1990s, 19% of the remaining natural landscapes (excluding areas covered by infrastructure, lakes and river floodplains) exhibited expansion of thermokarst features resulting in more abundant small ponds, greater microrelief, more active lakeshore erosion and increased landscape and habitat heterogeneity.

POPs travel globally in air and water, are often highly bioaccumulative, and have the ability to cycle among environmental media enabling long-range transport to remote regions such as the Arctic. The investigators will use a modeling approach to provide insight into the relative importance of changing primary anthropogenic emissions and oceanic biogeochemical processes in controlling the fate and lifetime of POPs in the Arctic Ocean. The research will focus on two classes of compounds (polyfluorinated compounds - PFCs - and polychlorinated biphenyls - PCBs) with contrasting physical and chemical properties affecting behavior and reactivity in the atmosphere and ocean. The investigators will also collect new data on depth profiles of PCBs and two PFCs - perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanate (PFOA) - in the Arctic Ocean. Three main objectives will be addressed in the proposed research:  1) Quantify the global and regional atmospheric budget of PCBs and PFCs, including relevant spatially-varying uncertainties  2) Quantify the budget of PCBs and PFCs in the Arctic Ocean, including inputs from atmospheric deposition, riverine inflows, and ocean cycling  3) Quantify the relative importance of atmospheric, oceanic, and riverine inputs of PFOA, PFOS and PCBs to the Arctic, including the influence of climate and emissions.  Ultimately this project will improve knowledge of how these compounds reach the Arctic and inform environmental management. The broader impacts component of the project will have three main goals: (1) Provide policy-relevant information to the Stockholm Convention and other international agreements on POPs to support monitoring and evaluation efforts for its controls on PCBs and PFOS and related compounds; (2) Inform sustainability education, by developing a case study on emerging POPs in the Arctic for courses relevant to environmental sustainability; and (3) train the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists (one graduate student will be trained at each of the three collaborating institutions).",NA,2020-09-25T18:00:12Z

Thus the objective of this proposal is to fill this gap in the Arctic Observing Network (AON) measurement strategy, i.e., to measure the time history of summer warming and subsequent fall cooling of the seasonally open water areas of the Arctic Ocean. The PIs will focus on those areas with the greatest ice retreat, i.e., the northern Beaufort, Chukchi, East Siberian, and Laptev Seas. Their method will be to build up to 10 relatively inexpensive ocean thermistor string buoys per year, to be deployed in the seasonally ice-free regions of the Arctic Ocean. The Arctic-ADOS (Autonomous Drifting Ocean Station) buoy will float at the ocean surface, equipped with (i) a sea level pressure sensor, (ii) a 50 m long string of 11 thermistors, and (iii) a high precision conductivity/temperature pair at 5 m depth on some buoys for thermistor calibration. Data will be recorded every 2 hours and downloaded in near real time via Argos satellite to the web site of the International Arctic Buoy Program (IABP). Daily average and vertically interpolated data (to 1 m bins) will also be provided on the IABP website, and will be sent to data archives (Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service-CADIS and National Oceanographic Data Center-NODC). The PIs will also work with scientists at mission-oriented agencies to better incorporate ocean surface data into their global products such as Sea Surface Temperature analyses. Real-time data will also be made available to the operational community via the Global Telecommunications System (GTS).

It allows for collateral posting adhering to bankruptcy laws. As such, the model can back out the market price of a collateralized contract. This framework is very useful for valuing outstanding derivatives. Using a unique dataset, we find empirical evidence that credit risk alone is not overly important in determining credit-related spreads. Only accounting for both collateral arrangement and credit risk can sufficiently explain unsecured credit costs. This finding suggests that failure to properly account for collateralization may result in significant mispricing of derivatives. We also empirically gauge the impact of collateral agreements on risk measurements.

This paper present a framework for assessing biogeochemical recovery of terrestrial ecosystems from disturbance. We identify three recovery phases. In Phase 1, nitrogen is redistributed from soil organic matter to vegetation, but the ecosystem continues to lose nitrogen because the recovering vegetation cannot take up nitrogen as fast as it is released from soil. In Phase 2, the ecosystem begins re-accumulating nitrogen and converges on a quasi-steady state in which vegetation and soil-microbial processes are in balance. In Phase 3, vegetation and soil-microbial processes remain in balance and the ecosystem slowly re-accumulates the remaining nitrogen.",2020-09-17T07:00:00Z,2020-09-21T18:27:20Z

Phenology, the annual timing and progression of events such as aboveground plant growth, is a well-studied an important component of the ecology of climate change, but remains under-studied belowground. This study will estimate and compare above- and belowground responses of plant phenology to warming and their respective contributions to ecosystem function, specifically the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and tundra. It will furthermore determine which plant types, e.g., shrubs or grasses, show the greater belowground response to warming and contribution to ecosystem carbon exchange. 

Novel insights into the expected response of the Arctic to climate change will emerge from this experiment, which will also expand the infrastructure for field-based experimental and observational research in the Arctic. This research will promote the involvement of under-represented groups by recruitment of students through Penn State?s Minority Undergraduate Research Experience program, and promote education and dissemination of its results through a summer field ecology module at the study site and in courses at Penn State and the University of Alaska-Anchorage.

Results so far indicate a freshening and warming of Pacific seawater which transits northward over the spring to fall season. These changes have impacted prey for larger marine mammals and seabirds. Satellite observations are also used to evaluate seasonal changes in sea ice concentration, surface seawater temperature, and chlorophyll concentration. The biological measurements focus on lower trophic levels and shipboard surveys of upper trophic level organisms.

It was designed for use with products from the Oregon State University (OSU) College of Veterinary Medicine Toshiba 64 Slice medical CT scanner, but has been tested on other medical CT scanner systems.  The program is documented by Reilly et al. (2017) and on the OSU Marine and Geology Repository website (www.osu-mgr.org/sedct). We also include sample CT data from a sediment core collected from Fish Lake, Utah (Reilly et al., 2018).  Computed tomography (CT) of sediment cores allows for high-resolution images, three-dimensional volumes, and down core profiles. These quantitative data are generated through the attenuation of X-rays, which are sensitive to sediment density and atomic number, and are stored in pixels as relative gray scale values or Hounsfield units (HU). We present a suite of MATLAB™ tools specifically designed for routine sediment core analysis as a means to standardize and better quantify the products of CT data collected on medical CT scanners. SedCT uses a graphical interface to process Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files, stitch overlapping scanned intervals, and create down core HU profiles in a manner robust to normal coring imperfections. Utilizing a random sampling technique, SedCT reduces data size and allows for quick processing on typical laptop computers. SedCTimage uses a graphical interface to create quality tiff files of CT slices that are scaled to a user-defined HU range, preserving the quantitative nature of CT images and easily allowing for comparison between sediment cores with different HU means and variance.

doi:10.18739/A2Q23R140,Matthew Johnson,Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: The Archaeological Investigation of Erosion and its Effect on Social Processes in the Arctic,archaeology,"This award supports a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement project to investigate the relationship between erosion and economic inequality over the environmentally and socially dynamic first 500 years of Norse settlement in Hegranes, Skagafjörður, Iceland. The agricultural practices of the first settlers of Iceland, ca. 870 CE, caused widespread deforestation and soil erosion. Erosion moves sediments from one place to another, and can lead to either landscape degradation or augmentation. On Hegranes small abandoned farms lie near large successful farms that still operate today, and eroded areas are interspersed with productive grassland. This patchwork landscape allows investigation of erosion as related to farmstead abandonment and the development of social inequality. This research has implication for understanding how coupled human and environmental systems today might affect processes of social change.  The researcher will use tephrochronology to compare the settlement sequence of small farms with associated environmental sequences of soil erosion and landscape change. The goal is to explore changes in number and distribution of small household farms, document processes of erosion, and investigate whether social reorganization of the landscape corresponds to increases in erosion. Larger, more powerful households likely benefited from abandonment of small farms, and this project will suggest how abandonment was managed to their advantage. This work will contribute to discussions about social and political consequences of human-initiated environmental change, focusing on unequal power relations between households that facilitate environmental degradation and social inequality.",2017-11-07T08:00:00Z,2020-07-20T18:08:29Z

doi:10.18739/A2ZK55N25,Derek Taylor,Population genetics of a climate-indicating predator across the forest-tundra ecotone,freshwater tundra ponds Alaska genome RNA virus zooplankton thaw pond climate,"Subarctic freshwater lakes and ponds in Alaska are important oases for polar biodiversity and resources for arctic peoples. However, this habitat is also among the most sensitive to disturbances such as heavy metal pollution, eutrophication, and drainage or desiccation from climate warming. Environmental indicator species in freshwater have both acted as sentinels for ongoing change and as proxies for historical change. Phantom midges (Chaoborus), for example, are among the most important freshwater dipterans for aquatic toxicology and for indicating a boreal zone climate. In some cases, Chaoborus is believed to be a better sentinel of boreal forest-tundra boundary changes than the tree line because trees can have a growth lag that is negligible in midges. The larvae of Chaoborus are also voracious predators of microcrustaceans and, as such, can strongly affect the species compositions of freshwater habitats. The PI has recently found that two species of Chaoborus are common well beyond the tree line in roadside ponds of the Seward Peninsula of northwestern Alaska. This finding provides an opportunity to improve understanding of how tundra lakes and ponds may change as they encounter a keystone predator of the boreal zone. Moreover, the effect of direct human disturbances such as road construction on the freshwaters of the boreal zone ? tundra boundary can be assessed.

Several aspects of the biology of Chaoborus in subarctic North America are poorly known. Because there are slight morphological differences between tundra species and well-studied temperate species, the geographic source and even the species name of the tundra populations are unclear. One objective of this research is to test hypotheses about the genetic affinities of Chaoborus that are presently found on the tundra. This involves phylogenetic comparisons of tundra specimens with those from eastern Asia, and with boreal Alaska. Another goal is to test the hypothesis that road construction has facilitated the expansion of boreal zone Chaoborus deep into the tundra. Testing this hypothesis involves testing for the erosion of genetic diversity on tundra ponds compared to forest ponds with high-resolution genetic markers. This project will also carry out paleoecological assessments of the rate and mode of colonization of tundra ponds. This research will inform environmental biologists, fisheries managers, engineers and planners about the role of human disturbance on the freshwater ecosystems across the tundra-boreal forest boundary at a critical time. The project will enhance or even enable comparative studies of environment-indicating chaoborids and promote a deeper understanding of recent and ongoing anthropogenic change in subarctic freshwaters. The speed and mode of colonization of tundra ponds by Chaoborus midges is important to paleoecology but unknown.",2017-08-31T07:00:00Z,2020-07-20T18:04:45Z

The GrIT route offers a unique opportunity to study a wide range of snow accumulation zones (i.e. the ablation zone, soaked snow zone, the percolation zone and the dry snow zone) across Greenland, which are expected to have a broad range of albedo values as well as significant variability in snow physical properties and concentrations of light absorbing compounds (i.e. dust, elemental carbon, and brown carbon). The project's field component will take place over two seasons during the spring of 2013 and 2014. The approach will include stopping along the traverse to collect coincident daily measurements of snow spectral albedo, snow physical properties (i.e. specific surface area, density), surface snow light absorption properties (i.e. wavelength dependent absorption of water soluble compounds and particulates), and the concentrations of trace elements, organic, and elemental carbon. Additionally, the temporal evolution of spectral albedo will be monitored continuously during the sunlit months using autonomous stations deployed along the traverse route to track seasonal variations of snow albedo and to help attribute these variations to the physical and chemical composition of the snow. The results of this project will yield a unique data set characterizing the temporal and spatial variability of surface albedo as well as the physical and chemical properties of Greenland snow, which are broadly useful to both modeling, ice mass balance, and remote sensing communities. Conference presentations, rapid publication of results, and most importantly close collaboration with modelers, (i.e. through work with the CESM PCWG) will ensure that this knowledge is used to improve process parameterizations in predictive global climate models. The team will also build on international collaborations begun in the Dartmouth IGERT program, including a week-long ambassadorship to Nuuk by co-PI Polashenski including lectures at the college and Katuuaq cultural center.

Jarvis Creek (634km2), which feeds the Delta and Tanana River in Interior Alaska, was studied as a proxy of the observed mountain glacier melting and permafrost degradation that has been documented across the Arctic region in recent decades. The specific objectives were to 1) assess the hydrologic fluxes (including streamflow source components), stores, pathways and the role of glacier wastage on watershed hydrology, through hydrologic and geochemical field measurements as well as numerical and statistical modeling; 2) quantify the effect of glaciers and permafrost on recent historical (1960-present) hydrologic fluxes and storage by combining remote sensing, field measurements of glacier mass balance, and hydrology with a heat- and mass transfer model, and 3) project the future hydrologic regime using custom-derived downscaled climate projections.
The purpose of this Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) data set was to 1) quantify winter snow accumulation hydrological contributions separately from the glacierized and non-glacierized regions of Jarvis Watershed; and, 2) estimate total glacier ice volume of Jarvis Glacier and, based on yearly mass balance calculations, estimate total future glacier contribution changes from Jarvis Glacier to hydrological discharge.  Winter accumulation ranged between 1.1 to 1.9 m SWE during each of the three seasons.  Jarvis Glacier ice volume calculated from geophysical surveys and a manually digitized glacier outline during late season 2015 was 1.16 km^3 within an area of 8.82 km^2.",2017-12-16T08:00:00Z,2020-07-21T18:12:01Z

Remarkably, the area burned in the YK Delta in 2015 exceeds the total area burned from 1940-2014 combined. The response of the YK Delta in the first year post-fire will set the stage for longer-term changes in delta carbon storage and transport among tundra, aquatic and marine systems, and to the atmosphere. Quantifying carbon export and understanding the immediate ecosystem response to fire is critical because long-term recovery is, to a considerable degree, dependent on short-term responses. A major question that this research will address is how fire influences the amount and form of carbon transported from delta ecosystems seasonally and in the first year following fire. Ultimately, these results will inform long-term trajectories of the vulnerability and fate of delta carbon pools. This research will significantly improve our understanding of the role of fire in the loss of both modern and ancient carbon from arctic river deltas, which contain &amp;amp;amp;gt;10% of the Arctic’s massive permafrost carbon store.  This funding will allow project scientists to engage with Alaska Native faculty and students in STEM-focused teacher training programs at the tribal college in Bethel, which will provide teachers with experience conducting research on climate change and arctic system science and the opportunity to develop curriculum focused on climate change and the feedbacks that result from fire and other changes in ecosystems in the Yukon River Delta. This project will also improve the infrastructure for arctic research and teaching at a small Undergraduate Institution in central Minnesota.  Arctic river deltas are hotspots for carbon storage, occupying &amp;amp;amp;lt;1% of the pan-Arctic watershed but containing &amp;amp;amp;gt;10% of carbon stored in arctic permafrost. They are also heterogeneous mosaics of linked terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and are susceptible to changes in land, river, and marine systems. The vulnerability of carbon stored in arctic river deltas is a major unknown and is critically important as climate warming and increasing fire frequency may make this carbon vulnerable to transport to aquatic and marine systems and to the atmosphere. The goal of this proposal is to examine the immediate effects of fire on carbon storage in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and exchange between terrestrial and aquatic components of the Delta. By extension this work will yield critical insights into how the carbon balance of deltas in the arctic system will change over the coming decades as warming continues and fire frequency increases.",2018-01-18T08:00:00Z,2020-07-21T18:31:11Z

Understanding subglacial flow is critical to developing models that accurately predict how glaciers will behave in response to warming climate and how glaciers will contribute to sea level rise. For outreach and educational purposes, the project will develop a web-based, interactive fluid dynamics tutorial concerning subglacial conduits. A project web site will also be developed. The project will contribute to workforce development by supporting the training of a graduate student and by providing partial support for three early-career scientists.

The project studies build upon previous work, and combine model simulations with satellite products and in situ observations to integrate and delineate physical causes of sea-ice mass balance changes in the context of storm-induced air-ice-sea interactions. This research will bridge synoptic-scale weather activities and large-scale climate variability and changes.

Scattered observations indicate that beavers (Castor canadensis) have moved from the forest into tundra areas during the last 20 years, likely in response to broader physical and ecosystem changes occurring in Arctic and Boreal regions. The implications of beaver inhabitation in the Arctic and Boreal are unique relative to other ecosystems due to the presence of permafrost and its vulnerability associated with beaver dams and inundation. Our study specifically examines the role of beavers in controlling surface water dynamics and related thermokarst development in low Arctic tundra regions. We mapped the number of beaver dams visible in sub-meter resolution satellite images acquired between 2002 and 2019 for a 100 square kilometer study area (12 years of imagery) near Kotzebue, Alaska and a 430 square kilometer study area (3 years of imagery) encompassing the entire northern Baldwin Peninsula, Alaska. We show that during the last two decades beaver-driven ecosystem engineering is responsible for the majority of surface water area changes and inferred thermokarst development in the study area. This has implications for interpreting surface water area changes and thermokarst dynamics in other Arctic and Boreal regions that may also result from beaver dam building activities.  This geospatial dataset provides polygon vector files representing surface water area in a 100 square kilometer study area located near Kotzebue, Alaska.

circulation model and focus on impacts to northern hemisphere midlatitudes

and concentrations (up to 37%), with particle-bound PAHs declining more,
and greater declines in midlatitudes versus the Arctic. Climate change causes
relatively minor increases in midlatitude concentrations for the more volatile
PHE and PYR (up to 4%) and decreases (3%) for particle-bound BaP. In the
Arctic, all PAHs decline slightly under future climate (up to 2%). Overall, we
observe a small 2050 ""climate penalty"" for volatile PAHs and ""climate benefit""
for particle-bound PAHs. The degree of penalty or benefit depends on
competition between deposition and surface-to-air fluxes of previously
deposited PAHs. Particles and temperature have greater impacts on future transport than oxidants, with particle changes alone accounting for 15% of BaP decline under 2050 emissions. Higher temperatures drive increasing surface-to-air fluxes that cause PHE and PYR climate penalties.

different partitioning configurations within the model to
reproduce observed total concentrations in the midlatitudes

distributions. The configurations tested are (1) the GEOS-
Chem default configuration, which uses instantaneous
equilibrium partitioning to divide PAHs among the gas
phase, a primary organic matter (OM) phase (absorptive),
and a black carbon (BC) phase (adsorptive), (2) an SOA configuration in which PAHs are trapped in SOA when emitted and slowly evaporate from SOA thereafter, and (3) a configuration in which PAHs are trapped in primary OM/BC upon emission and subsequently slowly evaporate. We also test the influence of changing the fraction of PAHs available for particle-phase oxidation. Trapping PAHs in SOA particles upon formation and protecting against particle-phase oxidation (2) better simulates observed remote concentrations compared to our default configuration (1). However, simulating adsorptive partitioning to BC is required to reproduce the magnitude and seasonal pattern of gasâparticle phase distributions. Thus, the last configuration (3) results in the best agreement between observed and simulated concentration/phase distribution data.

Using polynomial chaos (PC) methods, we propagate uncertainties in physicochemical properties and emissions for the PAHs benzo[a]pyrene, pyrene and phenanthrene to simulated spatially resolved concentration uncertainties. We find that the leading contributors to parametric uncertainty in simulated concentrations are the black carbon-air partition coefficient and oxidation rate constant for benzo[a]pyrene, and the oxidation rate constants for phenanthrene and pyrene. NH geometric average concentrations are more sensitive to uncertainty in the atmospheric lifetime than to emissions rate. We use the PC expansions and measurement data to constrain parameter uncertainty distributions to observations. This narrows a priori parameter uncertainty distributions for phenanthrene and pyrene, and leads to higher values for OH oxidation rate constants and lower values for European PHE emission rates.

Eighty years later, the IMO initiated a process to manage shipping in ice-covered oceans. In concert with the IMO Guidelines for Ships Operating in Arctic Ice-Covered Waters in 2002 and their 2004 release of the Arctic 2004 Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, the Arctic Council initiated the Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment (AMSA), which issued its final report in 2009. The goal of this chapter is to build on AMSA as a case study of informed decisionmaking through the steps of questions to generate data, which are then integrated into evidence to reveal options (without advocacy), informing decisions by relevant institutions to address a ‘continuum of urgencies’ that involve shipping in the new Arctic Ocean with its transformed sea-ice cap, assessing whether shipping is increasing as sea ice is decreasing (‘ship-ice hypothesis’). Primary sources of data for AMSA involved ship tracking from ground-station Automatic Identification System (AIS), shore-based radar systems and details of fishing vessels as well as other smaller ships provided by the Arctic nations. However, Arctic ship traffic fundamentally changed the year of the AMSA report, when satellite AIS records began providing continuous, synoptic, pan-Arctic coverage of individual ships with data pulsed over seconds to minutes. This chapter reveals the oldest and longest continuous satellite AIS record (from 1 September 2009 through 31 December 2016), applying the ‘spacetime cube’ (which also was unavailable during AMSA) with more than 120,000,000 satellite AIS messages from SpaceQuest Ltd. to begin addressing synoptic questions with any level of granularity from points to regions to pan-Arctic over time. Future questions can be considered to assess ship attributes (including vessel flag state, size and type) in view of biophysical and socio-economic variables, recognizing that shipping and sea ice are recognized as primary drivers of change in the Arctic Ocean. Contributions to these assessments come from all areas of science (inclusively defined as the study of change), across the natural and social sciences with Indigenous knowledge in an holistic (international, interdisciplinary and inclusive) manner to achieve Arctic sustainability across generations. As a practical outcome in a user-defined manner, this chapter reveals characteristics of next-generation Arctic marine shipping assessments, revealing patterns and trends that can be applied to informed decisionmaking about the governance mechanisms and built infrastructure as well as operations for multilateral stability and sustainable development in the new Arctic Ocean.",2020-01-01T08:00:00Z,2020-08-02T20:32:50Z

We use the model to estimate global budgets for seven PCB con- geners, and we demonstrate that congeners that deposit more readily show lower potential for long-range transport, consistent with a recently described ""differential removal hypothesis"" regarding the hemispheric transport of PCBs. Using sensitivity simulations to assess processes within, outside, or transport to the Arctic, we examine the influence of climate- and emissions-driven processes on Arctic concentrations and their effect on improving the simulated Arctic seasonal cycle. We find evidence that processes occurring outside the Arctic have a greater influence on Arctic atmospheric PCB levels than processes that occur within the Arctic. Our simulations suggest that re-emissions from sea ice melting or from the Arctic Ocean during summer would have to be unrealistically high in order to capture observed temporal trends of PCBs in the Arctic atmosphere. We conclude that midlatitude pro- cesses are likely to have a greater effect on the Arctic under global change scenarios than re-emissions within the Arctic.",2016-12-28T08:00:00Z,2020-08-05T20:31:22Z

These buoys were designed to make in situ observations of changes in the local sea ice mass balance and to determine the driving forces behind thermodynamic ice mass balance variations. They measure snow accumulation and ablation; ice thickness; ice growth; ice surface and bottom melt; the temperature profile from the air, through the snow and ice, and into the upper ocean; barometric pressure; and ice drift. Some SIMBs also record other parameters such as incident and transmitted light and changes in relative freeboard height. Results from these buoys have and will continue to enhance our understanding of the dramatic changes occurring in the Arctic sea ice cover. The dataset serves as a baseline documentation of Arctic mass balance, is valuable for validating large scale global climate models (GCMs) and small scale ice process models, and provides ground-truth data to support the development of instruments and algorithms to remotely sense snow depth, ice thickness, and the onset of melt and freeze-up.

Flow speeds contain both short- and long-term variations. The colored circle in the bottom left indicates year and time-of-year of current frame where red and blue colors correspond to summer and winter months, respectively. The inset shows the location of Jakobshavn within Greenland. The movie is a supporting asset for the manuscript (abstract following):  B. V. Riel, B. M. Minchew, and I. Joughin. Observing traveling waves in glaciers with remote sensing: New flexible time-series methods and application to Sermeq Kujalleq (Jakobshavn Isbræ), Greenland. submitted to The Cryosphere, 2020.  The recent influx of remote sensing data provides new opportunities for quantifying spatiotemporal variations in glacier surface velocity and elevation fields. Here, we introduce a flexible time series reconstruction and decomposition technique for forming continuous, time-dependent surface velocity and elevation fields from discontinuous data and partitioning these time series into short- and long-term variations. The time series reconstruction consists of a sparsity-regularized least squares regression for modeling time series as a linear combination of generic basis functions of multiple temporal scales, allowing us to capture complex variations in the data using simple functions. We apply this method to the multitemporal evolution of Sermeq Kujalleq (Jakobshavn Isbræ), Greenland. Using 555 ice velocity maps generated by the Greenland Ice Mapping Project and covering the period 2009 -- 2019, we show that the amplification in seasonal velocity variations in 2012 -- 2016 was coincident with a longer-term speedup initiating in 2012. Similarly, the reduction in post-2017 seasonal velocity variations was coincident with a longer-term slowdown initiating around 2017. To understand how these perturbations propagate through the glacier, we introduce an approach for quantifying the spatially varying and frequency-dependent phase velocities and attenuation length scales of the resulting traveling waves. We hypothesize that these traveling waves are predominantly kinematic waves based on their long periods, coincident changes in surface velocity and elevation, and connection with variations in the terminus position. This ability to quantify wave propagation enables an entirely new framework for studying glacier dynamics using remote sensing data.",2020-07-23T07:00:00Z,2020-07-27T16:14:04Z

O3 and CO2 are two of the most important greenhouse gases that have, as yet, poorly understood behavior in the Arctic. BrO is a reaction intermediate that is involved in the extraordinary ozone and mercury atmospheric depletion that occurs during polar springtime, both of which have strong consequences for human and ecosystem health in the Arctic region. These buoys are immersed through the sea ice into the ocean surface, thereby providing a constant temperature (-1.7 degrees C) environment for sensor stability. The original O-Buoy project funded by NSF included design and testing of the O-Buoy. In the current project, 11 new O-Buoys were constructed and deployed (sometimes twice) along with the four already built. As a pilot project, two of the new O-Buoys included seawater sensors for CO2, oxygen, pH, fluorescence, backscatter, temperature and salinity in addition to the atmospheric O3, BrO, and CO2 sensors. Throughout the project, data from each O-Buoy were subject to QA/QC protocols by automated processing initially, with preliminary data available on a regular basis on the NSF Arctic Data Center site. All final data and metadata are ultimately archived on Arctic Data after final analysis at the end of each deployment (please search under O-Buoy, Matrai and/or Simpson). This network of O-Buoys, coordinated and clustered with other buoys in ice based observatories, enabled the scientific community to first observe and, next, better understand the impact of Arctic surface change on atmospheric composition and chemistry.

This data set is an Arctic sea ice concentration climatology derived from the NIC weekly or biweekly operational ice chart time series. The charts used in the climatology are from 1972 through 2004, and the monthly climatology products are median, maximum, minimum, first quartile, and third quartile concentrations, as well as frequency of occurrence of ice at any concentration for 33 year, 10 year, and 5 year periods. These climatologies and the charts from which they are derived are provided in 25 km EASE-Grid (the NSIDC Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid/gridded binary). Ice extent can be derived from concentration by summing the number of equal area EASE-Grid cells. GIF browse files are also provided.

doi:10.18739/A2CR5ND3R,Karen Beard,Collaborative Research: Asynchrony in the timing of goose-vegetation interactions: implications for biogeochemical cycling in wet sedge tundra,"Yukon Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska weather trace gases greenhouse gases","Terrestrial high-latitude ecosystems are experiencing dramatic increases in temperature, changes in precipitation, and advancement of the growing season with important implications for trophic interactions. Uncoupling of the temporal relationships between migratory animals and the phenology of the forage they rely on for energy, nutrition, and rearing of young is one of the most glaring consequences of these changes. Furthermore, herbivores in high latitudes are likely to mediate biogeochemical responses to climate change substantially altering ecosystem function. However, little is known about how changes in the synchrony of herbivore-vegetation interactions will influence biogeochemical cycles.  This project will be conducted on the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) Delta in western Alaska, where there is strong evidence that climate change is driving temporal decoupling of the evolved linkage between the phenology of plants and the timing of goose migration. There is an urgency to the research because: some of the most rapid climate changes in the world are underway in Alaska, leaving migratory geese and the ecosystem processes they influence vulnerable to new conditions, and with the rapid advancement of the growing season, migratory goose feeding ecology is lagging substantially, threatening an irreplaceable subsistence resource for Native communities.  The overall research objective is to quantify how an advancing growing season and changes in the synchrony of vegetation-goose interactions alter the magnitudes and patterns of C and N cycling in the Y- K Delta. Two specific questions will be addressed with an experiment: How does the timing of plant growth interact with goose arrival time to alter summer-long magnitudes of plant production, foliar chemistry, and N availability?; and, How does the timing of plant growth interact with goose arrival time to alter summer-long magnitudes of net ecosystem CO2 exchange, gross ecosystem photosynthesis, and ecosystem respiration? SAVANNA-YK, a biogeochemical model that considers grazing a critical control on vegetation and trace gas processes in the Y-K Delta, will be used to predict how these ecosystem processes and plant-herbivore interactions will continue to change, altering the nature of ecosystem processes and landscape dynamics in years to come.  The intellectual merit of the research is three-fold: The focus on phenologic decoupling of migratory birds and their primary forage on ecosystem biogeochemical cycles is the first of its kind. More specifically, the research is the first to investigate how the timing of herbivory interacts with plant phenology to affect biogeochemical cycles compared to other programs that have focused on the presence or absence of herbivores and/or on herbivore density effects on these cycles; The research is the first to take an experimental approach to the issue of trophic mismatch in the western Alaskan sub-Arctic while integrating these findings with forecasting ecosystem models tailored to wet sedge systems of the north. This combination allows investigation into how climate change effects on herbivore-vegetation interactions will influence large spatial scales in years to come; and The research focuses on plant species that are critical to migratory geese, while other northern studies focusing on climate change effects have focused on tundra plant species that are not critical to migratory bird foraging ecology.  The broader impacts of the research will be realized through several activities. First, a citizen- science observatory will be established using protocols of the National Phenology Network. Students throughout the Y-K delta will record goose arrival times and key phenological events in grasses and woody plants. Second, students from Bethel Regional High School will be recruited to assist in the field research and be given the opportunity to develop small projects. Researchers will visit village classrooms each spring to introduce the project, climate change, and plant-animal interactions; share results of previous and ongoing research in the study area; and recruit interested students. Third, Native Alaskan undergraduate students through the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program (ANSEP) will be recruited as field and laboratory technicians; these students may also develop their own projects. Fourth, Virtual Science will be used with local teachers to develop blogs, pod-casts, and instructional videos that can be distributed to remote classrooms throughout western Alaska and beyond. Fifth, objectives and results will be communicated to Native organizational bodies, which have representatives from each major village, to build knowledge and support for the research, and provide educational outlets for families who rely on geese for subsistence. Finally, one post-doctoral researcher, one graduate student, and several undergraduates will be provided new training, mentoring, and an opportunity to collaborate on project activities and present their findings at scientific meetings.",2016-06-24T07:00:00Z,2020-10-08T17:28:58Z
