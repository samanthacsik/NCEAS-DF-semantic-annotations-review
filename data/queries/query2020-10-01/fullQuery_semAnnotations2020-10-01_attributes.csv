The main treatment of this experiment are snowfences built around trees at an arctic treeline (to induce larger snowdrifts). Similar trees were also selected for the control plots which have no fence. To reduce the impact of soil sampling on these trees over the course of four years an additional set of controls named the Ancillary plots were set up. The fertilized treatment NPK fertilizer containing 10 g/m2 nitrogen (N), 5 g/m2 phosphorus (P) and 10 g/m2 potassium (K) was evenly applied 1.5 m away from the main stem of each tree. N from: (NH4)2SO4, P from: P2O5, and K from: KCl.

The main treatment of this experiment are snowfences built around trees at an arctic treeline (to induce larger snowdrifts). Similar trees were also selected for the control plots which have no fence. To reduce the impact of soil sampling on these trees over the course of four years an additional set of controls named the Ancillary plots were set up. The fertilized treatment NPK fertilizer containing 10 g/m2 nitrogen (N), 5 g/m2 phosphorus (P) and 10 g/m2 potassium (K) was evenly applied 1.5 m away from the main stem of each tree. N from: (NH4)2SO4, P from: P2O5, and K from: KCl.
